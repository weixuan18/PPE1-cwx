2019 update: How long do refugees stay in exile? To find out, beware of
averages

   Number of refugees by years in exile

   longest situations, not of all situations. Most importantly, it refers
   to the duration of situations, not to the time people have stayed in
   exile.

   Take the situation of Somali refugees in Kenya. Refugees started to
   arrive massively around 1993, about 26 years ago. Their number now
   stands at 252,500. But can we say that all 252,500 have been in exile
   for 26 years?

   So what are the results?

   When we look at the "global refugee population" (see Figure 2), we can

   Now let’s group these figures by largest waves of arrivals (Figure 3):

   There is a large cohort of about 8.5 million "recent refugees," who

   Another large cohort, of about 6.4 million, has spent between 5 and 9
   years in exile. It includes refugees from Syria (3.6 million), South
   Sudan (0.6 million), the bulk of the current Somali refugees (0.3
   million), and people fleeing from Sudan (0.3 million), the Central

   Democratic Republic of Congo (0.2 million).

   About 3.2 million people have been in exile between 10 and 34 years.
   This includes years during which numbers are relatively low, and two
   episodes where they are higher, around 17 years ago, with the arrival

   the arrival of about 0.5 million Somalis and 0.2 million Eritreans.

   Lastly, a large group of refugees has been in exile for 35 to 40 years:
   these 2.2 million refugees include mainly Afghans (1.9 million), but
   also about 0.3 million Vietnamese who fled their country during the

   We can now turn to average durations. As of end-2018, the median
   duration of exile stands at 5 years, i.e. half of the refugees
   worldwide have spent 5 years or less in exile. The median has
   fluctuated widely since the end of the Cold War, in 1991, between 4 and
   14 years. By contrast, the mean duration stands at 10.3 years, and has

   But this leads to another important finding: trends can be
   counter-intuitive. In fact, a decline in the average duration of exile
   is typically not an improvement, but rather the consequence of a
   degradation of the global situation . The averages increase in years

   We also looked at the number of people who have spent more than five
   years in exile. As of end-2018, this number stands at 11.9 million. The
   number of protracted refugees had been remarkably stable since 1991 at
   5 to 7 million throughout most of the period, before dramatically
   jumping in the last 3 years.   For this group, the average duration of
   exile increases over time – largely because of the unresolved situation
   of Afghan refugees which pushes averages up. It is now well over 20
   years.
