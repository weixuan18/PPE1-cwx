   Napoleon's Exile on Saint Helena by Franz Josef Sandman (1820)
   The First Night in Exile – This painting comes from a celebrated series
   illustrating one of Hinduism's great epics, the Ramayana. It tells the
   story of prince Rama, who is wrongly exiled from his father's kingdom,
   accompanied only by his wife and brother.
   Dante in Exile by Domenico Petarlini [es]

   Exile is primarily penal expulsion from one's native country, and
   secondarily expatriation or prolonged absence from one's homeland under
   either the compulsion of circumstance or the rigors of some high
   purpose. Usually persons and peoples suffer exile, but sometimes social
   entities like institutions (e.g. the papacy or a government) are forced
   from their homeland.

   In Roman law, exsilium denoted both voluntary exile and banishment as a
   capital punishment alternative to death. Deportation was forced exile,
   and entailed the lifelong loss of citizenship and property. Relegation
   was a milder form of deportation, which preserved the subject's
   citizenship and property.^[1]

   The term diaspora describes group exile, both voluntary and forced.
   "Government in exile" describes a government of a country that has
   relocated and argues its legitimacy from outside that country.
   Voluntary exile is often depicted as a form of protest by the person
   who claims it, to avoid persecution and prosecution (such as tax or
   criminal allegations), an act of shame or repentance, or isolating

   Article 9 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that "No
   one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile."

For Inanimate Objects[edit]

   Ivan the Terrible once exiled to Siberia an inanimate object -- a
   bell.^[2] "When the inhabitants of the town of Uglich rang their bell
   to rally a demonstration against Ivan the Terrible, the cruel Czar
   executed two hundred (nobles), and exiled the Uglich bell to Siberia,
   where it remained for two hundred years."^[3]

Exiled heads of state[edit]

   Main article: List of heads of state or government who have been in
   exile

   In some cases the deposed head of state is allowed to go into exile
   following a coup or other change of government, allowing a more
   peaceful transition to take place or to escape justice.^[4]

Avoiding tax or legal matters[edit]

   Main articles: Tax exile and Fugitive

   A wealthy citizen who moves to a jurisdiction with lower taxes is
   termed a tax exile. Creative people such as authors and musicians who
   achieve sudden wealth sometimes choose this. Examples include the
   British-Canadian writer Arthur Hailey, who moved to the Bahamas to

   before the government could seize their assets. Members of the band all
   moved to France for a period of time where they recorded music for the
   album that came to be called Exile on Main Street, the Main Street of
   the title referring to the French Riviera.^[6] In 2012, Eduardo
   Saverin, one of the founders of Facebook, made headlines by renouncing

   Brazilian/U.S. citizen's decision to move to Singapore and renounce his
   citizenship spurred a bill in the U.S. Senate, the Ex-PATRIOT Act,
   which would have forced such wealthy tax exiles to pay a special tax in
   order to re-enter the United States.^[8]

   In some cases a person voluntarily lives in exile to avoid legal
   issues, such as litigation or criminal prosecution. An example of this
   is Asil Nadir, who fled to the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus for

   Examples include:
     * Iraqi academics asked to return home "from exile" to help rebuild
       Iraq in 2009^[9]
     * Jews who fled persecution from Nazi Germany^[10]
     * People undertaking a religious or civil liberties role in society
       may be forced into exile due to threat of persecution. For example,
       nuns were exiled following the Communist coup d'état of 1948 in
       Czechoslovakia.^[11]

Euphemism for convict[edit]

   Exile, government man and assigned servant were all euphemisms used in
   the 19th century for convicts under sentence who had been transported
   from Britain to Australia.^[12]

For groups, nations and governments[edit]

Comfortable exile[edit]

   Main articles: Social alienation and Identity (social science)

   Comfortable exile is an alternative theory recently developed by
   anthropologist Binesh Balan in 2018. According to him, comfortable
   exile is a "social exile of people who have been excluded from the
   mainstream society. Such people are considered 'aliens' or internal
   'others' on the grounds of their religious, racial, ethnic, linguistic
--
   religion, society or culture."^[13]

Nation in exile[edit]

   Main articles: Diaspora and Refugee

   When a large group, or occasionally a whole people or nation is exiled,
   it can be said that this nation is in exile, or "diaspora". Nations
   that have been in exile for substantial periods include the Jews, who
   were deported by Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar II in 586 BC and again
   following the destruction of the second Temple in Jerusalem in AD 70.

   the uprisings (like Kościuszko Uprising, November Uprising and January
   Uprising) against the partitioning powers (Russia, Prussia and
   Austria), many Poles have chosen – or been forced – to go into exile,
   forming large diasporas (known as Polonia), especially in France and
   the United States.^[15] The entire population of Crimean Tatars
   (numbering 200,000 in all) that remained in their homeland of Crimea
   was exiled on 18 May 1944 to Central Asia as a form of ethnic cleansing
   and collective punishment on false accusations.^[16]

   Since the Cuban Revolution, over a million Cubans have left Cuba. Most
   of these self-identified as exiles as their motivation for leaving the
   island is political in nature. At the time of the Cuban Revolution,
   Cuba only had a population of 6.5 million, and was not a country that
   had a history of significant emigration, it being the sixth largest
   recipient of immigrants in the world as of 1958. Most of the exiles'
   children also consider themselves to be Cuban exiles. Under Cuban law,
   children of Cubans born abroad are considered Cuban citizens.^[17]

  Government in exile[edit]

   Main article: Government in exile

   During a foreign occupation or after a coup d'état, a government in
   exile of a such afflicted country may be established abroad. One of the
   most well-known instances of this is the Polish government-in-exile, a
   government in exile that commanded Polish armed forces operating
   outside Poland after German occupation during World War II. Other
   examples include the Free French Forces government of Charles de Gaulle
   of the same time, and the Central Tibetan Administration, commonly
   known as the Tibetan government-in-exile, and headed by the 14th Dalai
   Lama.

  Literature[edit]

   In ancient Rome, the Roman Senate had the power to declare the exile to
   individuals, families or even entire regions. One of the Roman victims
   was the poet Ovid, who lived during the reign of Augustus. He was
   forced to leave Rome and move away to the city of Tomis on the Black
   Sea, now Constanta. There he wrote his famous work Tristia (Sorrows)
   about his bitter feelings in exile.^[20] Another, at least in a
   temporary exile, was Dante.

   The German-language writer Franz Kafka described the exile of Karl
   Rossmann in the posthumously published novel Amerika.^[21]

   During the period of National Socialism in the first few years after
   1933, many Jews, as well as a significant number of German artists and
   intellectuals fled into exile; for instance, the authors Klaus Mann and
   Anna Seghers. So Germany's own exile literature emerged and received
   worldwide credit.^[22] Klaus Mann finished his novel Der Vulkan [de]
   (The Volcano. A Novel Among Emigrants) in 1939^[23] describing the
   German exile scene, "to bring the rich, scattered and murky experience
   of exile into epic form",^[24] as he wrote in his literary balance
   sheet. At the same place and in the same year, Anna Seghers published
   her famous novel Das siebte Kreuz (The Seventh Cross, published in the
   United States in 1942).

   Important exile literatures in recent years include that of the
   Caribbean, many of whose artists emigrated to Europe or the United
   States for political or economic reasons. These writers include Nobel
