   40 miles (64 km) from Paris. Thenceforward Coppet was her headquarters,
   and in 1804 she began what she called, in a work published posthumously
   in 1821, her Dix Années d’exil (Ten Years’ Exile). From December 1803
   to April 1804 she made a journey through Germany, culminating in a
   visit to Weimar, already established as the shrine of J.W. von Goethe
--
   Italy, accompanied by Schlegel and Simonde de Sismondi, the Genevan
   economist who was her guide on the journey. Returning in June 1805, she
   spent the next seven years of her exile from Paris for the most part at
   Coppet.
