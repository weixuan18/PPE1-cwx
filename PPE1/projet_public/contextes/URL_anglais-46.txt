     __________________________________________________________________

   People who go into exile leave a lot behind, especially if they have to
   escape quickly. In their families, often the only ones who can follow
   are direct relatives like husbands/wives and children; possessions and
--
   and the new start is uncertain.

   Hundreds of thousands of people who went into exile between 1933 and
   1945 had to face these everyday struggles, including an estimated
   10,000 artists and scientists. They were cut off from the professional
   contacts that they had established over time and faced the challenge of
   finding adequate work. A large number of exiles were thus reliant on
   financial assistance from friends and acquaintances, benefactors and
   aid organisations. The reports from exiles repeatedly mention the
   inconvenience of having to ask acquaintances for money. In October
   1940, author Mascha Kaléko wrote in her New York diary that she and
--
   paid jobs to secure their families’ survival with their income, while
   their husbands tried to get their careers going in the receiving
   country. However, this situation also enabled many women in exile to
   overcome traditional gender roles and have successful careers.

--
   contacts and friendships were at times hard to establish in the
   receiving country. For many, social life consisted only of contacts to
   other exiles. In part, the societies in the receiving countries were
   suspicious of and rejected the refugees. These are problems still faced
   by exiles and refugees who have had to leave their home countries.
   Prejudices against foreigners and racism often make it harder to start
   over in a new culture.
