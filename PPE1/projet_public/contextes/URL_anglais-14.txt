A comedian in exile

   Despite all that he has been through over the past few years, Youseff
   says he doesn’t feel like an exile in the United States, a place he
   plans to make his permanent home.

   “I considered myself an exile even when I was in Egypt. You can be in
   your own country and be an exile if you can’t connect with your own
   people around you,” he said. “You can make your exile home. If you find
   a certain success there, if you find your path, your voice, that makes
   it home.”
