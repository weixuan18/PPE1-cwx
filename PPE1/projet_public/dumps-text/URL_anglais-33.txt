   High numbers of local journalists have fled several African countries
   in recent years after being assaulted, threatened, or imprisoned,
   leaving a deep void in professional reporting. The starkest examples
   are in the Horn of Africa nations of Somalia, Ethiopia, and Eritrea,
   where dozens of journalists have been forced into exile. Zimbabwe,
   Rwanda, and the Gambia have also lost large segments of the local press
   corps in the face of intimidation and violence.

   Those who flee their native countries pay a high price: Facing
   cultural, language, and legal obstacles, they struggle to find work in
   their profession. CPJ research shows that only one in three is able to
   continue working as a journalist. But the public also pays dearly for
   the exodus of professional, local reporters from these countries, all
   of which have had internal strife with international implications. Not
   only had domestic audiences relied upon these front-line journalists,
   so too had international reporters, who used local coverage as a base
   of information and depended on local reporters for the sort of sources
   and knowledge only a native can have.

   Yet it is not simply a shortage of reliable information that has
   resulted, journalists say. Perversely, in some instances, the exodus of
   professional journalists has enabled governments or political factions
   to exert editorial control over once-independent news outlets. “The
   high exile rates of journalists have not brought a lack of information
   so much as misinformation,” said Abdiaziz Hassan, a local correspondent
   for Reuters in Somalia. “It incites the conflict further.”

   Among the hardest hit has been Radio Shabelle, a Somali station that
   had earned a reputation for independent reporting. Situated in
   Mogadishu’s Bakara Market—home to a number of media outlets, but also a
   base of operations for the militant insurgent group Al-Shabaab—the
   station has seen five of its journalists killed, numerous staffers
   threatened, and several forced into exile. Without sufficient
   management on site, the station has been susceptible to pressure from
   Al-Shabaab to censor its coverage and even broadcast the group’s
   propaganda, according to Mohamed Amin, a former Shabelle deputy
   director now in exile.

   In all, CPJ has documented the cases of 30 Somali journalists who have
   gone into exile this decade, the fourth-highest tally worldwide during
   the period. CPJ’s data on exiled journalists include only those
   journalists who fled due to work-related persecution, who remained in
   exile for at least three months, and whose whereabouts and activities
   are known. Local organizations using different criteria report higher
   numbers. The Union of Exiled Somali Journalists, for example, counts as
   many as 80 exiled reporters. Most of these exiles have fled in the face
   of astonishing violence: Twenty-one Somali journalists have been killed
   in direct connection to their work since 2005, some at the hands of
   government forces, many at the hands of militant groups such as
   Al-Shabaab.

   Here’s another common thread: Most of the exiled Somali journalists
   speak English. That’s no coincidence, noted former Shabelle reporter
   Ahmednor Mohamed, who said insurgents have targeted English-speaking
   journalists in Mogadishu as “spies.” That, in turn, has a domino effect
   on international reporting.

   Among international news outlets, only the satellite channels
   Al-Jazeera and Al-Arabiya maintained an ongoing presence in the country
   in late year. Paul Salopek, a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter who has
   covered the continent for many years, noted that few international
   journalists even venture into Somalia, particularly Mogadishu, because
   of the severe risks. International correspondents are forced instead to
   report by phone from Nairobi, Kenya. “That’s how isolated we’ve become
   from the story on the ground,” said Salopek, who called war and drought
   conditions in Somalia “one of the worst humanitarian crises in the
   world.” Without reliable local reporters to provide baseline
   information, the task of telling the Somali story to the world has
   become extraordinarily difficult.

   “There’s little question that the decimation of Somali journalists—by
   assassination or through exile—has reduced the quantity and quality of
   news coming out of that country,” Salopek said. “They were the first
   responders, if you will, to breaking news in Somalia. And most of them
   are gone.”



   In Ethiopia and Eritrea, mass imprisonments of journalists early in the
   decade have been followed by years of steady repression. The threat of
   jail has led at least 41 Ethiopian journalists and 24 Eritreans into
   exile, CPJ data show, although local groups suggest the figures may be
   much higher.

   Ethiopian authorities have regularly used the law as leverage against
   the press, enacting two pieces of legislation in 2009 that further
   repress news coverage. An antiterrorism measure sets prison terms of up
   to 20 years for anyone who “writes, edits, prints, publishes,
   publicizes, or disseminates” statements that the government vaguely
   describes as advancing terrorist interests. The deceptively named Mass
   Media and Freedom of Information Proclamation stiffens penalties for
   libel and grants government prosecutors authority to censor
   publications on national security grounds.

   For an Ethiopian press corps that saw 13 of its colleagues jailed in a
   massive 2005 crackdown, the passage of new, restrictive legislation
   sent a clear message: The government of Prime Minister Meles Zenawi was
   again ready to imprison critical reporters and editors. “Everything
   became illegal,” said Wondrad Debretsion, an Ethiopian editor who
   recently went into exile. “Even state-sponsored reporters have started
   fleeing the country.” The continuing exodus has weakened the
   independence of the remaining Ethiopian press. The Awramba Times, a
   once critical publication, has taken a newly sympathetic stance toward
   the government, said Debretsion, who served as the paper’s deputy
   director before leaving the country in July.

   No government has decimated the press corps as thoroughly as that of
   Eritrea, where in 2001 the administration of President Isaias Afewerki
   rounded up 18 critical editors and reporters, jailed them without
   trial, and held them in secret locations. The crackdown pushed other
   independent reporters into exile, and effectively shuttered the
   independent press. The government’s heavy-handed repression has also
   forced out state-employed journalists, one of whom, Paulos Kidane, died
   while trying to flee the country on foot for Sudan in 2007.

   Gambian authorities have also used intimidation tactics: Seven editors
   and reporters were jailed for a month in 2009 on trumped-up charges of
   sedition; journalist “Chief” Ebrima Manneh was believed to be held in a
   secret government jail; and the government continued to show little
   interest in solving the 2004 murder of editor Deyda Hydara. Such
   tactics have prompted at least 13 journalists to flee since 2007,
   according to the Gambia Press Union. That number becomes eye-opening
   when one considers that the Gambia has just two independent newspapers
   and a population of 1.7 million. The journalists who remain often
   censor their work or simply avoid sensitive topics.

   “There is no incentive for in-depth reporting or investigative
   journalism anymore as it can land one in trouble with authorities,”
   said Musa Saidykhan, a Gambian journalist who fled after being tortured
   by state security agents in 2008.

   Government harassment has also played a role in Rwanda, where at least
   10 independent journalists have fled. Half of those journalists had
   contributed reporting to foreign media outlets, CPJ research shows.
   Robert Mukombozi, a Rwandan whose work as a correspondent for the
   Ugandan daily The Monitor had offended authorities, was ordered out of
   the country in 2009 on fabricated charges that he lacked citizenship.
   Lucie Umukundwa, a correspondent for the U.S. government-funded Voice
   of America, left in 2006 after unidentified men attacked her brother in
   reprisal for her reporting.

   “I was used to arrests and intimidations,” Umukundwa told CPJ, “but
   this was the first time my family was attacked.”

   Only two independent weeklies remain in Rwanda’s capital, Kigali. The
   director of one of those papers, Charles Kabonero, said the loss of his
   colleagues has not only lowered professional standards, it has left
   remaining journalists feeling isolated and less interested in pursuing
   independent stances. The private weekly Rushashya, which had been known
   as a critical news source, publicly announced in 2009 that it would
   take a more pro-government editorial stance.



   Many exiled African journalists face great challenges and continuing
   risk. The Union of Exiled Somali Journalists said about half of its
   members eke out a precarious existence on the dangerous streets of
   Kenya’s capital, Nairobi. Most fled so precipitously that they took few
   belongings or identification papers. The exile union, along with the
   National Union of Somali Journalists, both said they had received
   reports that Somali exiles have faced arbitrary harassment and
   detention at the hands of Kenyan police.

   The Rwandan Mukombozi told CPJ that members of his family had been
   assaulted twice in Kigali after he was forced into exile. “All that
   psychological pressure more than triples when such incidents happen,”
   he said by e-mail, “and the restricted communication between the exiled
   journalist and his/her family makes the harm on both sides enormous.”

   Gambian journalists seeking refuge typically move to Dakar, Senegal,
   but they are rarely at ease because of the suspected presence of
   Gambian security agents, said Demba Jawo, former head of the Gambian
   Press Union. “Sometimes exiled Gambian journalists feel compelled to
   move periodically to avoid detection from these security agents,” he
   said.

   Even those in safe circumstances face enormous professional challenges.
   At least 48 Zimbabwean journalists have been forced into exile since
   2000, most of them in the early half of the decade during sustained
   harassment by President Robert Mugabe’s government, according to CPJ
   research. In interviews with CPJ, many of these Zimbabwean journalists
   have said that it took years for them to re-establish themselves
   professionally and secure sound economic footings for their families.
   Many had to abandon journalism as a career.

   Yet some who revived their careers also created a vibrant diaspora news
   media. Gerry Jackson, an exiled Zimbabwean journalist, launched the
   London-based SW Radio in 2001. The station broadcasts programming into
   Zimbabwe in English and in the Shona and Ndebele languages. Wilf
   Mbanga, another exile, started The Zimbabwean newspaper in 2005. Based
   in his new home in England, Mbanga produces a weekly that circulates in
   the United Kingdom, South Africa—and Zimbabwe. Abel Mutasakani, who
   left for South Africa in 2004, joined with other colleagues to start
   the Web publication ZimOnline.

   Ethiopian and Eritrean exiles have similarly launched Web sites,
   typically focusing on events back home. While limited in what they can
   report firsthand, these sites receive and report leaked documents,
   interview disaffected government sources, and offer critical political
   commentary.

   The irony that exiled journalists are getting independent news and
   views into their native countries is not lost on people such as the
   Zimbabwean Geoff Hill. “Since nationalizing the press in 1981, Mugabe
   has done his best to control the flow of information, but now there are
   so many leaks in the bucket, it is more like a watering can,” said
   Hill, himself an exiled journalist who still reports on the country.
   “Much of the credit for this must go to the hard breed of Zimbabwean
   journalists—both at home and in exile—who refuse to surrender.”
