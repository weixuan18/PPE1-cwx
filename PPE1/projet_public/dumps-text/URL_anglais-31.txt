   Since 2001, CPJ has documented the cases of 340 journalists forced into
   exile after their reporting exposed them to harassment, violence, or
   imprisonment. They face many difficulties in their new homes, from
   language and cultural adjustments to emotional and economic hardships.
   Here are five snapshots of journalists in exile.

   DINA YAFASOVA

   Reporter, Sygeplejersken (The Nurse)

   Yafasova (Courtesy Dina Yafasova) Yafasova (Courtesy Dina Yafasova)

   Country of origin: Uzbekistan

   New home: Denmark

   Date of exile: 2001

   Reason for leaving: Yafasova fled after she was threatened with
   imprisonment during an interrogation at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
   in Tashkent. She was questioned about a 2001 article in the Danish
   journal Sygeplejersken. Written under a pseudonym, the article
   described her experiences with government censorship. Two men also
   assaulted Yafasova on the street, taking her notes, tape recorder, and
   audiotape.

   Life in exile: Yafasova won asylum in Denmark in 2002 and was joined by
   her family. She has continued writing but has suffered the effects of
   her persecution in Uzbekistan. Eventually, she spent 11 months at the
   Centre for the Rehabilitation of Torture Victims in Copenhagen. Her
   2006 book “Diary from Sandholm” describes her experiences in a Danish
   refugee camp in 2001.

   On the freedom of exile: “Exile freed me from shackles. In exile, I
   could achieve a much greater degree of human freedom, which never could
   be achieved under dictatorship in my homeland. And this feeling of
   being a free person has a much bigger value for me than a feeling of
   belonging to the place where I was born.”

   SALEEM SAMAD

   Samad (Pavel Rahman) Samad (Pavel Rahman)

   Correspondent,
   Bangladesh Observer

   Country of origin: Bangladesh

   New home: Canada

   Date of exile: 2004

   Reason for leaving: Samad was under constant surveillance by military
   security forces following his January 2003 release from prison, where
   he had spent two months on antistate charges. The accusations stemmed
   from his work with a documentary crew for Britain’s Channel 4
   “Unreported World” series. In 2004, security agents raided his home,
   questioning his family about his whereabouts, and threatening to
   “greet” him at the airport if he returned from a conference in Canada.

   Life in exile: Samad opted to remain outside the country and to seek
   asylum, which he won in January 2005. His family joined him in Canada
   in 2006, and he has held various non-journalism jobs since—as a
   security guard, a concierge, and a salesman. Once a prominent voice in
   Bangladesh, he was met with closed doors when he tried to continue
   working for Bangladeshi papers while in exile. He now contributes
   pieces to expatriate news Web sites and runs the pro-democracy blog
   Bangladesh Watchdog.

   On the professional cost of exile: “After I lost my steady job with the
   Bangladesh Observer, the international press stopped requesting
   contributions of articles about the region.”

   MESFIN TESFAYE

   Editor-in-Chief, Abay

   Country of origin: Ethiopia

   New home: Kenya

   Date of exile: 2007

   Reason for leaving: Tesfaye fled from the harassment and threats that
   followed his release from prison in 2007. He had spent 18 months in
   custody on antistate charges stemming from critical coverage of a
   flawed 2005 election. Tesfaye was under regular surveillance and was
   receiving phone calls warning that if he “acted against the
   constitution,” he would be killed.

   Life in exile: Tesfaye has spent the past year in Nairobi, awaiting
   refugee resettlement through the United Nations High Commissioner for
   Refugees. In November 2007, Tesfaye and two fellow exiled journalists
   were assaulted in their apartment by men they believe were Ethiopian
   government agents. Tesfaye and his exiled colleagues keep a low
   profile. Unable to find work, they rely on small contributions from
   international organizations and family members in the diaspora.

   On the hardest part of life in exile: “Survival. There is no work here
   in Nairobi. You ask: Where will I get money? You are worried so much.
   Then you are forced to ask somebody, forced to be a beggar.”

   Gonzalez Raga (Agence France-Presse) Gonzalez Raga (Agence
   France-Presse)

   ALEJANDRO GONZÁLEZ RAGA

   Freelance reporter

   Country of origin: Cuba

   New home: Spain

   Date of exile: 2008

   Reason for leaving: González Raga boarded a flight to Spain immediately
   following his February release from prison, where he had served five
   years of a 14-year sentence on a charge of threatening “the territorial
   integrity of the state.” He was among 29 writers and editors jailed in
   the Cuban government’s March 2003 crackdown on the independent press.
   His release, along with that of fellow reporter José Gabriel Ramón
   Castillo, followed negotiations between the Spanish and Cuban
   governments. Prior to those talks, CPJ provided the Spanish government
   with information supporting the reporters’ release. Life in exile:
   González Raga is now publishing his prison writings, and he makes
   occasional contributions to Spanish media outlets. He struggles to
   provide for his seven family members in Spain, although he still seeks
   to have his father and a son, both of whom remain in Cuba, join him as
   well.

   On the emotional adjustment after prison: “When you are unjustly
   imprisoned, when you are taken away from your family, there are no
   tools to mend the pain.”

   ARASH SIGARCHI

   Blogger and editor

   Country of origin: Iran

   New home: United States

   Date of exile: 2008

   Reason for leaving: Sigarchi escaped to the United States while on
   medical leave from prison in Rashat, where he was serving a three-year
   sentence on charges that included espionage, engaging in propaganda
   against the system, and undermining national security. The charges
   followed interviews he gave to BBC World Service radio and the U.S.
   government-funded Radio Farda.

   Life in exile: Sigarchi lives outside Washington and has applied for
   political asylum. Unable to get employment while his work permit is
   being processed, and in need of assistance to cover living and medical
   expenses (he developed mouth cancer in prison), Sigarchi depends on
   help from friends and contributions from human rights organizations. He
   is learning English and hopes to further his media studies and to
   teach.

   On the decision to go into exile: “Maybe you expect I’d complain about
   exile, but I’m satisfied here because this is my choice. I had two
   options: one, to stay in Iran and be in prison under torture, and two,
   to be in exile.”
