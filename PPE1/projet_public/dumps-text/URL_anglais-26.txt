Napoleon abdicates the throne and is exiled to Elba

   On April 11, 1814, Napoleon Bonaparte, emperor of France and one of the
   greatest military leaders in history, abdicates the throne, and, in the
   Treaty of Fontainebleau, is banished to the Mediterranean island of
   Elba.

   The future emperor was born in Ajaccio, Corsica, on August 15, 1769.
   After attending military school, he fought during the French Revolution
   of 1789 and rapidly rose through the military ranks, leading French
   troops in a number of successful campaigns throughout Europe in the
   late 1700s. By 1799, he had established himself at the top of a
   military dictatorship. In 1804, he became emperor of France and
   continued to consolidate power through his military campaigns, so that
   by 1810 much of Europe came under his rule. Although Napoleon developed
   a reputation for being power-hungry and insecure, he is also credited
   with enacting a series of important political and social reforms that
   had a lasting impact on European society, including judiciary systems,
   constitutions, voting rights for all men and the end of feudalism.
   Additionally, he supported education, science and literature. His Code
   Napoleon, which codified key freedoms gained during the French
   Revolution, such as religious tolerance, remains the foundation of
   French civil law.

   Downfall

   In 1812, thinking that Russia was plotting an alliance with England,
   Napoleon launched an invasion against the Russians that eventually
   ended with his troops retreating from Moscow and much of Europe uniting
   against him. In 1814, Napoleon’s broken forces gave up and Napoleon
   offered to step down in favor of his son. When this offer was rejected,
   he abdicated and was sent to Elba. In March 1815, he escaped his island
   exile and returned to Paris, where he regained supporters and reclaimed
   his emperor title, Napoleon I, in a period known as the Hundred Days.
   However, in June 1815, he was defeated at the bloody Battle of
   Waterloo. Napoleon’s defeat ultimately signaled the end of France’s
   domination of Europe. He abdicated for a second time and was exiled to
   the remote island of Saint Helena, in the southern Atlantic Ocean,
   where he lived out the rest of his days. He died at age 52 on May 5,
   1821, possibly from stomach cancer, although some theories contend he
   was poisoned.
