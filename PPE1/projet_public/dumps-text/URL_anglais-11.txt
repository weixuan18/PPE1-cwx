Zelenskyy and Ukraine's survival – it may be time to consider a government in
exile

Zelenskyy faces a dramatic stay-or-leave decision as the Russian army
converges upon him

   As Russian forces solidify their stranglehold on Kyiv, President
   Volodymyr Zelenskyy must be prepared to stand up a government in exile
   if the capital falls.

   Vlad the Invader seeks to install a puppet regime in Kyiv as soon as
   his tanks and troops occupy the city. At that point, it will be too
   late for Zelenskyy, or any of his senior ministers, to escape death or
   captivity.

   War demands hard choices. And now President Zelenskyy faces a dramatic
   stay-or-leave decision as the Russian army converges upon him.

   UKRAINE'S FIGHTING COSSACK SPIRIT – STALINIST PUTIN WON'T PREVAIL

   Zelenskyy has shown tremendous courage by staying in Kiev since Russia
   invaded Ukraine earlier this month. His decision clearly stiffened the
   will of the Ukrainian military to resist and inspired ordinary citizens
   to take up arms.

   But there is something to be said for living to fight another day. The
   decision to relocate is not the same as raising a white flag. Far from
   it. It would represent a prudential choice to continue the fight from a
   more secure foxhole.

   No one faulted Charles de Gaulle when he established a government in
   exile in London during World War II. Nor was he alone. Eight other
   allied governments, to include Norway, Belgium and Poland, set up shop
   in London, helping to mobilize military forces in exile to liberate
   Europe from Nazi tyranny.

   Closer to home, recall that President James Madison left the White
   House for a spell as the British torched Washington, D.C., during the
   War of 1812.

     No one should begrudge Zelenskyy now if he decides to set up camp
     elsewhere.

   No one should begrudge Zelenskyy now if he decides to set up camp
   elsewhere. He has already earned his street cred as a national
   leader. As so-called target number one, he has endured great personal
   risk since day one of the Russian invasion.

   What are the options if he decides to relocate? Zelenskyy could
   relocate to the western part of Ukraine, the only part of the country
   that has remained relatively unscathed from Russian attack so far. But
   this would likely buy his government only a few days before the Russian
   armored columns pivot in hot pursuit.

   There are other alternatives. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has already
   extended an invitation to Zelenskyy. If not London, then perhaps
   someplace closer to Ukraine might do. Warsaw could be an attractive
   option, since Poland borders Zelenskyy’s home country and has already
   accepted a record number of Ukrainian refugees.

   Zelenskyy is his own man. He may well choose to resist until death in
   Kyiv. If so, he will die a hero’s death. Or he may opt to continue the
   resistance from elsewhere.

   "I need ammunition, not a ride," he famously declared a few days
   ago. Well, he has successfully secured ammunition for the resistance,
   with weapons pouring in from the United States, Canada and numerous
   European countries (even Germany has joined!).

   What the Ukraine government needs most right now is to ensure its own
   survival given the increasingly barbaric Russian onslaught. Whether he
   stays in Kyiv or not, Zelenskyy must lay the groundwork for a
   government in exile, to ensure his government survives if Kyiv falls to
   the invader.

   A government in exile will help ensure that Ukraine maintains its
   proper seat in international fora, to include the United Nations.

   The government in exile can also spearhead the international effort to
   support the resistance with Ukraine, as well as a humanitarian
   assistance campaign to deal with the impact of Moscow’s naked
   aggression. Zelenskyy, or his designated successor, will have the
   freedom to rally support around the globe. In contrast, Putin will
   likely remain holed up in Moscow or one his secret lairs, an
   international pariah.

   Setting up a government-in-exile for a country of more than 40 million
   people is no small feat. Beyond providing diplomatic support and
   defensive weaponry to Ukraine, the United States should be prepared to
   assist a government in exile with immediate assistance -- computers,
   secure communications, office equipment and security -- wherever
   Zelenskyy directs his government to set up camp.

   Whatever his decision, President Zelenskyy has already left his mark on
   history with his exemplary courage. By setting up a government in
   exile, he will help to ensure his country’s future.
