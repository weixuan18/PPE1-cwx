For Turkish journalists in Berlin exile, threats remain, but in different
forms

   For Can Dündar, sitting in the audience of a theater performance near
   Dortmund in Germany in May was an emotional moment. In an interview
   with CPJ, he recalled how during the premiere night, he watched the
   main actor on stage playing a journalist as he was imprisoned in
   Turkey, had his house searched, his books banned, and then had to leave
   the country and start a new life in exile in Berlin, leaving behind his
   wife, whose passport was confiscated by the authorities. The journalist
   on the stage was Dündar himself, and the dramatic events unfolding were
   his own life, as the performance was based on his autobiographical
   book, “Traitor,” published in Germany in 2017.

   In one scene, the main character starts a conversation with his police
   security detail in Germany, telling the man charged with protecting him
   from attack how he misses his dog, left behind in Turkey. “The
   policeman I had the conversation with in real life was sitting next to
   me, and we both realized how close we got,” Dündar said.

   The moment Dündar described was symbolic: getting close to a police
   officer and sharing an emotional moment was unimaginable in Turkey,
   where police are a constant source of fear. It demonstrated how much
   life in exile is different from the one left behind in Turkey, but at
   the same time highlighted the persistence of threats. I spoke with
   Dündar and two other Turkish journalists living in Berlin about their
   work and life in exile and the dangers they face in their new
   environment.

   “One big difference is how the blue light and sounds of the police cars
   in the street during the night do not worry me any longer,” Hayko
   Bağdat told me. He left Turkey with his family and settled in Berlin in
   2017 after being threatened and investigated by Turkish authorities
   because of his reporting, especially after the attempted coup against
   President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in July 2016. “On coming to Germany, I
   could finally sleep normally during the nights,” Bağdat said.

   Zübeyde Sari, a relative newcomer to Berlin having arrived in December
   2018, told me how much relief it was for her not to have to deal with
   authorities because of her reporting. “I only have to meet authorities
   when I do my paperwork concerning my stay here,” she said.
   Hayko Bağdat, a Turkish journalist in exile in Berlin, moves around
   with so many police officers that 'people might think I am Brad Pitt.'

   Brad Pitt.’ (Hayko Bağdat)

   While all three journalists expressed relief over not having to
   continuously fear Turkish authorities, other risks remain. “Threats are
   my destiny,” Bağdat said sarcastically, noting the number of daily
   threats he receives on social media has not changed since he moved to
   Germany. “I get hundreds of harassing social media messages daily, some
   of them clear threats and sometimes direct death threats too,” Bağdat
   said.

   In Turkey, Bağdat had a talk show on national broadcaster IMC TV, wrote
   columns for the now-banned Turkish investigative daily Taraf, the
   Armenian weekly Marmara and the news website Diken. He is active on
   social media with more than a million Twitter followers. “I am a hate
   subject first because I am Armenian and second because of the criticism
   I have toward the Turkish government,” he said.

   Dündar, the former editor-in-chief of Cumhuriyet newspaper and a
   recipient of CPJ’s 2016 International Press Freedom Award, is one of
   the most prominent Turkish journalists in exile. He had to leave his
   country in June 2016 after he was continuously harassed by authorities
   and sentenced to prison on charges of revealing state secrets for a
   report alleging that Turkey had tried to ship arms to Islamists in
   Syria. “I have an arrest warrant against me in Turkey,” he said.

   For Dündar, threats are not always virtual. His face is well known
   across Turkey and among the Turkish community in Germany where, a 2018
   study found, the roughly 3 million people with Turkish roots feel more
   strongly connected to Turkey than to Germany, and around two-thirds of
   them support Erdoğan. In Berlin, Dündar founded and manages a nonprofit
   online radio station and newsletter called Özgürüz (“We are free”),
   banned in Turkey, as well as writing regular columns in German
   newspapers and publishing books. “I get regular insults in the street
   from ordinary people, taxi drivers who are often Turks in Berlin call
   me traitor, people sometimes take photos and videos of me walking in
   the street and put them online,” Dündar said. On one occasion, a
   Turkish TV crew showed up at the door of his office, filmed him, and
   put the address on the internet. Dündar said he thinks more and more of
   moving to London where the Turkish community is more diverse and he
   might be less exposed to such harassment.

   “When I meet someone here, it is difficult to speak about Turkey as
   they sympathize with the Erdoğan government but I know that they are
   far from the Turkish reality, they just get their information from the
   propaganda,” said Zübeyde Sari, who is a reporter and producer at
   Dündar’s Özgürüz radio. She feels hostility from the local Turkish
   community toward new emigres, and is harassed on her social media
   accounts. Prior to coming Germany, she worked as a reporter at IMC TV
   and earlier with BBC Türkçe, where her coverage included opposition
   movements and protests.

   Both Dündar and Bağdat live under some kind of police protection
   because of various risks, from the Turkish intelligence agency’s widely
   reported practice of kidnapping dissidents (or trying to) and bringing
   them home to possible physical attacks and even death threats. They
   told me that German authorities continuously assess the risks for
   whether 24-hour protection is needed or some lower level security can
   be applied. Although they are free to exercise their journalism, the
   tight security makes it difficult to report.

   “There are periods when German police think the danger is so great that
   I have to be accompanied by security details everywhere I go,” Dündar
   said. That was especially the case in 2018, when president Erdoğan
   visited Berlin and called on the German authorities to extradite him,
   and threatened to cancel the joint press conference with Chancellor
   Angela Merkel if he would also be present. To solve the diplomatic
   gridlock which put his German hosts in an uncomfortable situation,
   Dündar decided not to attend the press conference. “Once you are
   publicly pinpointed by Erdoğan, the threat level is raised,” he told
   CPJ.

   “People might think that I am Brad Pitt or some kind of VIP, I have
   sometimes so many policemen accompanying me, especially when I go to
   any public event,” said Bağdat, who has performed one-man theatrical
   shows, always amid tight security, sometimes wearing a bulletproof
   vest. “I am trying to find home jobs to make a living in Berlin, as for
   me leaving home for work is almost impossible,” he said.

   For Dündar, traveling outside Germany is also a challenge as he cannot
   be sure whether Turkey’s international arrest will be eventually
   enforced by one of the countries he visits. In one strongly positive
   development, though, he was reunited with his wife in June after three
   years of separation as she managed to escape from Turkey, where
   authorities had confiscated her passport.

   The separation had added an extra level of symbolism to the stage
   design of the play based on his life. “It was a golden cage and when
   the woman held hostage in Turkey reproaches the man in the cage for not
   being able to see her son, also living outside Turkey, because of him
   for years, I heard sobs all around,” Dündar said.
