   On June 24, a grenade was thrown through the window of Voice of America
   correspondent Diane Nininahazwe’s home. It was one of three cases CPJ
   has documented in recent months where grenades were thrown into the
   homes of journalists in Burundi’s capital, Bujumbura. Fortunately,
   there have been no fatalities, but there have also been no arrests.

   The attack at Nininahazwe’s house happened the day after she received
   threatening text messages. Nininahazwe had just returned from Gihanga,
   north of Bujumbura, where she had been reporting on abductions. She
   told CPJ she was too frightened to report the incident to police and
   has been in hiding ever since.

   Since April 26, when Burundians took to the streets to protest
   President Pierre Nkurunziza’s unconstitutional bid for a third term,
   CPJ has documented a series of attacks on journalists. The crackdown
   intensified after an attempted military coup on May 13. Media outlets
   and radio stations were attacked and in some cases burned to the
   ground, and many of the journalists employed at them have been harassed
   and threatened, according to reports and journalists with whom CPJ
   spoke.

   On August 20, despite a disputed election, Nkurunziza was quietly sworn
   in for a third term. No foreign head of state attended the
   inauguration. The recent closure of the country’s four leading
   privately owned radio stations, which have all been attacked or ordered
   by authorities to stop broadcasting, meant fewer journalists were there
   to witness the event too. The attacks on these stations and journalists
   has induced an exodus, leaving coverage sparse during a sensitive
   period.

   Estimates from the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees
   suggest about 180,000 civilians have fled Burundi since the protests
   began, with the majority traveling to neighboring Rwanda. CPJ and the
   Burundi Union of Journalists are aware of at least 100 journalists who
   have left the country since April. The journalists who left said they
   had been threatened, or feared persecution and a lack of employment
   after stations were shut down by authorities or set on fire during
   protests.

   An exiled journalist who used to work for Renaissance Radio and
   Television told CPJ the station had come under pressure from the
   government during protests in April to report favorably or be closed
   down. The journalist, who asked not to be named, said that the pressure
   increased after the station covered the coup.

   Before the threats of closure could be acted on, the privately owned
   station was burned down during clashes and unrest in the city on May
   14.

   Another journalist, who asked not to be named and who worked for
   Bonesha FM before the independent station was set alight during unrest
   around the same time as Renaissance Radio, said: “We were routinely
   intimidated during the unrest on the street by the ruling party youth
   militia, the Imbonerakure. They would check your laptop, your phone,
   even any social media accounts you have–as if they had any legal
   authority to do so.” The journalist, who hid in a truck carrying sacks
   of tea and whose two children managed to join him in exile, added:
   “Police just sit idly by and let these armed youth do as they please,
   the situation was so precarious, you never know what might happen.”

   Calls by CPJ to the Bujumbura police and a government spokesman to ask
   for a response to the claims made by the journalists were not answered.

   The Renaissance Radio and Television journalist, who managed to escape
   the country with his wife and children on what he described as a
   harrowing bus ride, said: “The worst part is trying to explain this
   senseless situation to our children, I am often lost for words.”

   Life in exile is far from easy. Compared to Burundi, Rwanda can be
   expensive, and many journalists fled with few possessions or prospects
   for work. The majority have their families with them, a journalist
   still in Burundi and who asked to remain anonymous because of security
   fears, told CPJ. Relatives who stayed behind have been forced into
   hiding for fear of retributive violence. Former senior journalists in
   exile have found themselves sharing cramped rooms, surviving on one
   meal per day, said Bonesha FM Director Patrick Nduwimana. The support
   organization Rwanda Journalists Association has helped some of those in
   exile by providing a guesthouse and space for the journalists to work,
   the association’s executive secretary, Gonzaga Muganwa, said.

   So many journalists have left that only the state broadcaster and a
   handful of faith-based radio stations that do not cover news are still
   in operation, according to local journalists. “The Burundi press used
   to be openly critical of the government,” Muganwa said. “Now there are
   no Burundians on the ground to capture the story fully–it’s an
   advantage for the [government].”

   Nduwimana, who also acts as the head of an association of independent
   Burundi broadcasters, agreed. “There is now a blackout, for instance,
   on human rights violations that were previously made public by
   Burundi’s independent press,” Nduwimana told CPJ. “Every day people are
   kidnapped and killed,” he said, referring to claims of abductions and
   attacks reported by Amnesty International and international news
   outlets. Nduwimana highlighted how, without an independent press to
   report on such issues, future human rights violations could go
   undocumented.

   Those still reporting in the country must be extremely careful,
   according to Innocent Muhozi, the director of Renaissance Radio and
   Television and independent media support organization, the Burundian
   Press Observatory. Muhozi who decided to remain in Bujumbura, was
   quoted in a news report saying that he can no longer assign staff to
   cover certain places because of the dangers. A journalist with the
   state broadcaster, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, added that
   “journalists who are working, especially journalists at state
   broadcaster Burundi National Radio and Television (RTNB) are not
   trusted by the public and consequently are targeted by police for one
   side, protesters and the public on the other side.” The journalist said
   the scope of what can be safely covered is limited. Alleged killings
   cannot be investigated without fear that the journalist will be next,
   the reporter told CPJ.

   Before the crackdown, people in Bujumbura routinely listened to the
   radio through their phones, tuning in daily around noon for the news,
   the Renaissance Radio and Television journalist, who asked not to be
   named, said. But without access to independent broadcasters, the public
   will be “stuck relying on rumors rather than impartial information,”
   Nduwimana, of Bonesha FM, said. He is involved in a project with some
   of the journalists living in exile, who launched an online radio
   station named Nzamba, which refers to a traditional trumpet. It
   broadcasts a daily news program focused on Burundi.

   Although its impact may appear negligible–Burundi has the lowest
   Internet penetration in East Africa with only 1.38 percent individual
   usage in 2014, according to the International Telecommunication Union
   statistics–Burundians who do have access to the Internet share
   information with others through a variety of means. Audio files are
   disseminated to smart phones though apps such as What’sApp, according
   to Nduwimana.

   Although there were mixed views from the journalists with whom CPJ
   spoke on whether the situation in Burundi will improve any time soon,
   they agreed that access to independent news would help. One journalist,
   who did not wish to be identified, told CPJ: “This has been caused by
   the political crisis, so it will be improved if the government shows
   the will to reopen or give more space [to] private media. To be
   operational, journalists must be seen as contributors not destroyers.”
