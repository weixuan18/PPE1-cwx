   1“Do we all belong to this country?” asks Nada Mustafa Ali in her book
   entitled: Gender, Race and Sudan’s Exile Politics. The title of the
   book is taken from a speech given in 1998 in Cairo by anthropologist
   Sharif Harir, the vice president of the Sudan Federal Democratic Party
   and member of the Sudan’s National Democratic Alliance’s executive
   office at that time, in which he discussed structural racism in the Old
   Sudan. While the issues of racism, gender and belonging have been at
   the centre of Sudanese politics in the Old Sudan, they were also key in
   the debates in 1990s and 2000s about the visions of the New Sudan, a
   term coined by John Garang in 1983. Although much less discussed in the
   book, Nada Ali’s research, however, is also relevant to issues of
   nation-building projects that both Sudans have faced since their
   separation in 2011. These concerns are even more relevant in the
   current situation in Sudan, with the regime change that took place in
   2019 due to the civil protests initiated in December 2018. Who belongs
   and how in the post-revolutionary Sudan is at the heart of the current
   debates about citizenship and rights in the country.

   2In eloquently written 6 chapters, the book discusses race relations
   and politics in Sudan starting from the 1950s till the separation in
   2011. Using gender and intersectional perspectives, Ali examines the
   discourses and practices of the Sudanese opposition in exile. The
   author carefully analyses the interplay between gender and race, and to
   a lesser extent social class and religion, as tenants shaping Sudanese
   identity and power relations. Through a historical perspective, Ali
   delves into the contemporary dynamics of women’s participation,
   discussions around women’s human rights, nationalism and gender
   equality in Sudan and in exile. She examines these questions looking
   closely at the opposition movements organised under the umbrella of the
   National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in exile in the 1990s and early
   2000s. She skillfully places these debates in a wider historical
   perspective of Sudanese politics which are developed in chapter 3,
   sketching out the interplay of colonialism, nationalism and Islamism
   and the way they have resulted in socioeconomic and political exclusion
   and resistance.

   3One of the main contributions of the book is its longitudinal
   research, and Nada Ali’s personal involvement in the opposition
   movement and exile politics since mid-1990s and her particular
   commitment to feminist coalition building among different Sudanese
   women’s groups. In the introductory chapter, she discusses her
   positionality and shows how her political choices influenced her
   research. She was also a strong proponent of the New Sudan vision,
   which she saw, as many at that time, as an emancipatory project that
   was concerned with racial/cultural and regional difference. This
   reflexive account about her positionality adds depth to her analysis
   and shows how her personal stands are intertwined with her research
   subjects. Based on multi-sited ethnographic, document review and
   discourse analysis research in Egypt, Kenya, and Eritrea between 1998
   and 1999, and on research of activisms in Sudan, South Sudan, and in
   the diaspora between 2010 and 2014, using feminist and intersectional
   analysis, the book shows how gender and race play key role in shaping
   contemporary political debates in Sudan and South Sudan. More
   importantly, these issues are also central to the ways women’s
   movements have been organising in the two countries since the mid
   1950s. They are also, as Ali demonstrates, the limits to the
   transnational coalition building centered on women’s issues in the two
   countries and in the diasporas.

   4The book is organized into 6 chapters followed by a conclusion and an
   epilogue. The introduction sets the scene and effectively introduces
   the key focus of the book, while providing an elegant grounding of the
   concepts in academic, especially feminist, writings on nationalism,
   gender and intersectionality, and nation-building projects. The book is
   firmly anchored in feminist theorisations of nationalism, with
   particular references to Nira Yuval-Davis’s work which clearly
   influenced Ali’s thinking, coalition building and the role of women’s
   movements in nation building. It provides rich interview material and
   in-depth analysis of documents and speeches, as well as author’s
   encounters with the different women’s groups and activists in exile.
   Ali provides detailed feminist and intersectional analysis of Sudanese
   women’s activisms throughout the 20^th century, with a careful
   examination of the activities of exiled Sudanese and South Sudanese
   women in the 1990s and 2000s. Chapter 4 examines in depth the gendered
   discourses and, and to a lesser extent, practices of the Sudanese
   opposition in exile. Chapter 5, on the other hand, focuses its analysis
   on the ways gender and race were intertwined in the emancipatory
   project of New Sudan. Ali shows also how this vision turned later into
   further oppression and marginalisation. Chapter 6 provides some
   insights into how women’s movements in Sudan and in South Sudan, as
   well as in the diasporas in Egypt and in Kenya, tried to resist further
   marginalisation and exclusion, yet their actions were not always
   successful. The coalition building proved difficult based on the deep
   racist and classist divisions.

   5The subject of the book is thematic given the current political
   changes in Sudan and the role women played in the uprising in 2019. The
   book clearly shows that despite difficult political situation and the
   constraints imposed on women in Sudan under the sharia law since the
   1980s, with more drastic regulations pertaining to personal freedoms
   linked to the Public Order act of 1999, women have also played an
   active role in Sudanese politics and strived to carve out a place for
   their activism. It is a compelling, well-written and insightful account
   of the politics of gender and race relations that underlie
   transnational coalition building among women’s groups. The book is a
   valuable contribution to the history of women’s movement in Sudan and
   in South Sudan, and the role of women in the nation building projects
   in the two countries.

   6Some of the shortcomings of the book are also acknowledged by the
   author. The vast of the research is focused among Northern Sudanese
   women activists, and the South Sudanese and other regional women’s
   groups are covered to a much lesser extent. The historical take on
   women’s activism in South Sudan, before the separation but also after,
   is tackled in a rather superficial way. Much more research is needed to
   show the historical diversities and regional particularities to women’s
   organising and women’s participation in nation-building processes in
   Sudan in general, and in South Sudan in particular. Nonetheless, the
   book offers important insights into the gendered politics of social
   movements, of nationalism, and deeply imbedded patriarchy in Sudan.
   While focused on particular case study, the book draws wider
   implications for understanding these phenomena worldwide.

   7The intersectional analysis with a particular focus on race is key to
   understand how gender and race are essential to make sense of social
   movements and social transformations. Social class and religion are
   important parameters, yet the book does not focus its analysis on them.
   Written by an engaged feminist academic, this book is a valuable read
   for academics, politicians and foremost activists committed to build a
   new Sudan, and more widely, inclusive and equal citizenship projects
   worldwide.
