   DEBATE HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR REFUGEES
   STATEMENT BY MR. NICOLAS DE RIVIERE,
   PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE OF FRANCE TO THE UNITED NATIONS
   AT THE SECURITY COUNCIL

   New York, November 2, 2022

   Mr. President,

   I would like to thank Mr. Grandi for his speech and especially for his
   remarkable work at the head of the office of the United Nations for the
   High Commissioner for Refugees.

   As you mentioned, Mr. High Commissioner, this year we have reached the
   sad record of 100 million displaced persons throughout the world. The
   causes of these displacements are diverse: the multiplication of
   conflicts, the worsening of food insecurity and malnutrition in the
   world, climate change. Displaced women and girls also suffer from
   specific difficulties that we must address: access to sexual and
   reproductive health, exposure to higher risks of sexual violence.

   In this context of crisis, UNHCR’s mandate remains more fundamental
   than ever and I would like to salute the remarkable work, courage and
   dedication of all the staff of the Office.

   Since the beginning of Russia’s illegal aggression against Ukraine,
   Europe has experienced the largest displacement of people in the world,
   the largest since World War II, with 7.5 million refugees and 6.5
   million internally displaced people. In response to this tragedy,
   France is doing its utmost: it has pledged 200 million euros in
   humanitarian aid, welcomed more than 100,000 Ukrainians and provided
   schooling for more than 20,000 children who have fled the war. France
   will continue to support the UNHCR’s action in support of the millions
   of displaced Ukrainians, in particular to protect them from the
   combined effects of the war and the cold winter.

   Support for Ukraine in no way diminishes the attention given to other
   humanitarian crises. France is fully mobilized to respond to other
   emergencies, particularly in the Sahel and the Middle East. As of 2021,
   we have doubled our voluntary contributions to the UNHCR and are now
   the 8th largest donor. Similarly, France is assuming its share of
   responsibility by resettling refugees on its territory and receiving
   people in need of protection. Providing assistance to people forced
   into exile is a duty.

   We must do everything we can to help countries that are on the front
   line of large-scale displacement. It is only through a solidarity-based
   approach that we will be able to improve the care of refugees and
   displaced persons. In this context, the threats to food security and
   nutrition impose a duty of solidarity. France is mobilized through the
   FARM initiative, the "Save crops" operation and the European solidarity
   corridors.

   It will co-sponsor the next World Refugee Forum at the end of 2023.
   This meeting should allow for greater cooperation in the reception of
   refugees and the strengthening of asylum systems throughout the world.

   Finally, we will not compromise with the fundamental principles
   concerning the return of refugees. In Syria, the regime is sorting out
   the refugees, thus continuing by other means its policy of demographic
   engineering carefully implemented since the beginning of the conflict.
   This is why I repeat: the conditions for a dignified, safe and
   voluntary return are not met. Only the regime can remove the obstacles
   to return. It is essential that the UNHCR be able to ensure effective
   monitoring of Syrian refugee returnees and the conditions for their
   return.

   Finally, Mr. President, it is up to this Council to create the
   conditions for a lasting settlement of the crises, in order to address
   the root causes of population displacement.

   I thank you
