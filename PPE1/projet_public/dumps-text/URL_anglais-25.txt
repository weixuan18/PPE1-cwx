Former Cote d’Ivoire militia leader Ble Goude back home after exile

   Charles Ble Goude, a former militia leader who was acquitted of crimes
   against humanity related to his role in Cote d’Ivoire’s civil war,
   returned from exile on Saturday as politicians sought to reconcile
   after years of instability and conflict.

   Hundreds of supporters wearing clothes printed with Ble Goude’s image
   sang and danced in the Yopougon suburb of Abidjan to welcome him home
   after eight years.

   The return of Ble Goude following his acquittal by the International
   Criminal Court in The Hague in 2019 is part of a wider rapprochement
   between political factions in Cote d’Ivoire, that President Alassane
   Ouattara hopes will reduce political tension ahead of elections in
   2025.

   “I dreamed of this moment from my prison cell,” Ble Goude told the
   crowd that stood in the pouring rain. “You will accompany me in this
   peace process that our country needs.”

   Much of Cote d’Ivoire’s tension stems from a brief civil war following
   a 2010 election, after which former president Laurent Gbagbo failed to
   accept defeat to Ouattara. Tensions have been simmering since and at
   least 20 people died in clashes when Ouattara decided to run again in
   2020 elections.

   Gbagbo, who was ousted during the civil war and was also acquitted of
   war crimes in The Hague, returned home last year after a decade in
   exile.

   Ble Goude, who headed the notorious Young Patriots street militia
   during Gbagbo’s presidency, was accused of inciting attacks on
   civilians and United Nations soldiers.

   He was sentenced in absentia to 20 years in prison by a court in
   Abidjan in 2019 for his role in the civil war. Ble Goude told Radio
   France International last week that he expects those charges to be
   dropped once he returns.
