Story highlights

   Kurdish photographer Warzer Jaff spends week documenting Yazidi Kurds

   ISIS has hounded Yazidis from their ancient homeland in northern Iraq

   Tens of thousands of families have sought shelter in Iraqi Kurdistan

   Each refugee shares horrifying stories of abduction and murder
   Irbil, Iraqi Kurdistan CNN  —

   They are the faces of an entire community on the run.

   Singled out, threatened, chased at gunpoint from their homes.

   Pursued purely because they are members of an ethnic and religious
   minority.

   Iraq’s Yazidi Kurds are no strangers to persecution. Their faith
   teaches them that throughout history, they have been subjected to 72
   genocides. Many world leaders fear they are on the brink of a 73rd
   massacre, this time at the hands of the Islamic State in Iraq and
   Syria, which calls itself the Islamic State.

   ISIS: We've taken Yazidi women, children

   Kurdish photographer Warzer Jaff spent a week documenting the exodus of
   the Yazidis from their ancient homeland. What is immediately striking
   in his portraits are their piercing eyes.

   “I am fascinated with the deep sadness in their eyes,” Jaff says. “You
   don’t see one single happy face.”

   There is little room for joy when one has been made instantly homeless.

   In the weeks since ISIS militants overran cities and towns in northern
   Iraq, the Yazidis joined a modern-day exodus of hundreds of thousands
   of other Iraqis. Most of those fleeing come from the many other ethnic
   and religious minorities that make up the mosaic of the region,
   including Chaldeans, Assyrians, Turcomen, Shi’ites, Shabbak, Kurds.

   Instantly made homeless, tens of thousands of these families have
   sought shelter in Iraqi Kurdistan. Driving through this region, one can
   see families squatting under bridges, camping in derelict buildings,
   unfinished construction sites, churches, youth centers, open fields.

   Each refugee shares horrifying stories of abduction and murder. Even
   more disturbing, the frequent refrain that “our neighbors did this to
   us.”

   Their claims that Arab tribesmen joined in the looting and kidnapping
   of these defenseless minorities suggests there is little hope these
   communities will one day live side by side together again in peace. As
   one senior Kurdish official put it, “the social fabric has been torn.”

   “I don’t want to live with Arabs anymore, they take our land, they
   kidnap our women, and they kill us, why should I live with them?” asked
   Ali Khalid, 75, a Yazidi.

   He wandered amid the tents of a brand new refugee camp leaning on a
   cane; his long white mustache, a proud symbol for Yazidi men, drooping
   over his mouth. Like nearly every other displaced Iraqi we met over the
   last week, Khalid urged Western governments to grant his people asylum
   in Europe or North America.

   Not far away, a grieving mother showed a laminated identity card. It
   belonged to her 20-year old daughter, Baran. She was fatally wounded by
   shrapnel two weeks ago, Khokhe Namir said, while racing out into the
   backyard to pull a child back to safety.

   “I buried her with my own hands,” Namir said, scraping at the dirt with
   her fingers, as tears streamed down her cheeks.

   Amid the grief and despair, there are still moments of childlike
   innocence. In a refugee camp for Iraqis that sprouted up in a
   Kurdish-controlled enclave in Syria, a red-haired girl picked through a
   pile of second-hand clothes donated by local Kurds.

   “I like the bright colors and the flowers,” she said, after eyeing a
   long dress decorated with pink flowers.

   Last Friday, Jaff wandered up from a tent in a refugee camp in Iraqi
   Kurdistan visibly shaken. “There’s a newborn baby who was born on the
   mountain, I’m afraid she’s going to die,” he said.

   In the tent, the parents of the 6-day-old girl had bound their infant
   in a sheet and laid her on the dirt, atop a pile of blankets and
   cushions. They didn’t have a cradle for the child.

   The girl was born on Sinjar Mountain. Tens of thousands of Yazidis
   sought refuge on its heights as they fled ISIS fighters, only to find
   themselves trapped and surrounded by the militants.

   Jaff took the little girl’s parents into town and bought them a cradle
   and extra food for their baby. Across the Kurdish regions of Iraq and
   Syria, there have been many similar acts of kindness and generosity
   from locals toward their less fortunate cousins from farther south.

   The baby’s parents told me despite the heat, she was eating normally.
   The girl appeared healthy. Her mother said she was thinking of naming
   her child Hajar. Loosely translated, that means migrant or as the
   family interpreted it, “Exile.”
