   Reuters  —

   After bolting to Ukraine to escape political persecution in her native
   Belarus, Olympic swimmer Aliaksandra Herasimenia never thought she
   would again be forced to flee, this time to save her family from
   Russian attack.

   Herasimenia, a three-time Olympic medalist, found herself among
   thousands of Ukrainians massing at the border with Poland as Russian
   troops advanced on Kyiv.

   On the second day of the Russian invasion last month, Herasimenia and
   her husband, Olympic swimmer Yauhen Tsurkin, scrambled to pack some
   belongings and set off on a 12-hour car ride to the Polish border with
   their young daughter and Herasimenia’s mother.

   With explosions resounding in the background as they inched along
   congested roads, Herasimenia reassured her three-and-a-half-year-old
   daughter, telling her it was only thunder.

   “Of course I had to make something up because how do you explain to a
   child that war has started?” Herasimenia, who is now in Warsaw with her
   family, told Reuters.

   Herasimenia was among the elite athletes who fled Belarus in the wake
   of a crackdown against those who protested what they said was the
   fraudulent re-election of Alexander Lukashenko in August 2020.

   Lukashenko, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has
   denied any wrongdoing.

   Russia has used Belarusian territory to launch a multi-pronged invasion
   of Ukraine, where many Belarusians settled after escaping persecution
   at home. Moscow says it is conducting a “special military operation” to
   disarm and “denazify” Ukraine.

   “We’ve been running for a long time,” said Herasimenia, whose family
   waited for nearly a day and a half at Ukraine’s border with Poland.

   “Those who left were the best of Belarusian society, those who were
   against what happened after the election, those who spoke out against
   the violence and expressed their position.”

‘Fighting for freedom’

   Herasimenia heads the Belarusian Sport Solidarity Foundation, a group
   that supports athletes who have been jailed or otherwise punished for
   their political views.

   These include Krystsina Tsimanouskaya, a sprinter who defected at the
   Tokyo Olympics last year after being removed from the Games against her
   will by coaches.

   wearing 'Z' symbol next to Ukrainian athlete

   Following a recommendation by the International Olympic Committee
   (IOC), several international sports federations have barred both
   Russian and Belarusian athletes from taking part in international
   events because of the invasion of Ukraine.

   The foundation has backed the decision to ban Belarusian athletes but
   says it supports efforts by those who voiced opposition to Lukashenko
   to compete independently.

   It is also determined to fight discrimination against Belarusians now
   that their country is viewed an “aggressor” by the public in many
   Western countries, Herasimenia said.

   “A year and a half ago, we were the ones who were fighting for our
   rights, our freedom,” said Herasimenia, who won silver in both the 100m
   and 50m freestyle at the 2012 London Games, and bronze in the 50m
   freestyle at the 2016 Rio Olympics.

   “We called on the Europeans, Americans and everyone in Ukraine for
   help. We warned that Lukashenko was very dangerous.

   “It’s as if this never happened … No difference is being made between
   those who support Lukashenko and those who fought against him.”
