Story highlights

   Yemen's President had been in exile for six months

   War has resulted in the death of at least 4,000 civilians, rebels say
   CNN  —

   Yemeni President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi arrived in the southern Yemeni
   city of Aden on Tuesday after six months in exile in Saudi Arabia,
   Yemeni Foreign Minister Riyad Yassin told CNN.

   Last week, Yemeni Prime Minster Khaled Bahah and several Cabinet
   members from the internationally recognized government arrived in Aden
   and announced they were restarting government operations in the
   country.

   Hadi and his government had been in exile in Saudi Arabia since March,
   when Shiite Houthi rebels took over Sanaa, the Yemeni capital.

   Saudi Arabia and its coalition partners launched airstrikes on Houthi
   positions across Yemen in March, hoping to wipe out the Iranian-allied
   rebel group that overthrew the government and seized power.

   The southern city of Aden is under the control of the Saudi-backed
   coalition forces that support Hadi. But fighting between Houthi rebels
   and forces loyal to Hadi continues to rage elsewhere in the country.

   The six-month war has left at least 4,000 civilians dead, according to
   the Houthi-controlled Health Ministry.
