Exile studies in Germany

     Aufgabe der Exilforschung scheint mir demnach zu sein, das
     kommunikative und das kulturelle Gedächtnis zugleich an einem
     historisch und anthropologisch verbindlichen Gegenstand zu schulen.
     Eine solche Exilforschung [...] würde gehört und verstanden werden,
     weit über die Kreise der „Betroffenen“ und die Fachkreise hinaus.

      [Accordingly, it seems to me that the job of exile studies is to
     train both the communicative and cultural memory using a
     historically and anthropologically relevant object. Studying exile
     in this way [...] would be listened to and understood far beyond the
     circle of those “affected” and outside of academic circles. (ed.
     trans.)]


    Wolfgang Frühwald, Die „gekannt sein wollen“. Prolegomena on a theory
    of exile, 1995
     __________________________________________________________________

   What is it that exile studies deal with? The question about what
   subject matter exile research should deal with is one that has to be
   asked again and again. Today, in an era of migration, in which almost 3
   percent of the world population is made up of international migrants
   according to the German UNESCO Commission, issues such as the impact of
   exile on the countries of origin and the receiving countries, and the
   transfer of knowledge and culture are matters of interest for the world
   of research. The beginnings of exile studies are to be found in the
   early post-War period. Back then, it was those in exile who took it
   upon themselves to draw attention to the topic by providing overviews
   and anthologies about it.

   With the onset of the Cold War and the founding of two German states,
   research work became restricted by political and ideological
   influences. In the GDR, where top political and cultural posts were
   filled by returned emigrants, research work focused on communist
   resistance and anti-fascist exile. In the Federal Republic, by
   comparison, a phase began during which public discussion was
   suppressed. Instead of looking at exile, West German historians
   concentrated on the civilian, church and military opposition to the
   Nazi regime.

   It was not until the middle of the 1960s that the changing social and
   political climate saw the beginning of a new phase of critically
   examining the Nazi past. The German Exile Archive of the German
   National Library laid down the groundwork for dealing with the subject
   in its 1965 exhibition Exil-Literatur 1933-1945. Research began by
   looking at literary and political exile in congresses, symposia and
   some initial publications. In 1969, the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft
   (German Research Foundation, DFG) provided funding and soon put
   together a programme of selective measures in the area of exile
   studies. The “other Germany” and the definition of anti-fascism were
   core aspects in the West German research work. Werner Berthold wrote
   that what was needed, was something usable that went beyond the
   theoretical and he pointed out that there was a risk in this process of
   only seeking what one wants to find and only seeing part of the complex
   reality (in: Nach dem »Paradigmenwechsel«. Brita Eckert and Harro
   Kieser in conversation with Werner Berthold, 1996). The mid-1980s saw
   further change and subjects like academics in exile (and in connection
   with this a turn towards acculturation research), exile among “normal”
   people (Wolfgang Benz) and research into women’s issues and gender came
   into focus. The expansion in research work to include Jewish exile was
   also down to a change in public awareness. The television series
   Holocaust (1979), the documentary film Shoah (1985) and the controversy
   among German historians in the 1980s are all evidence of this change in
   perception. The distinction, which had prevailed for many years,
   between political exile on the one hand and non-political – mainly
   Jewish – emigration on the other was abandoned.

   In 1984 the Gesellschaft für Exilforschung (German Exile Research
   Society) was set up with Ernst Loewy as its first chairman. For many
   years now, the field of exile research has been receiving input from
   the newer cultural studies, which critically re-examine terms like
   identity and homeland and are oriented towards the future we will be
   facing due to migrational movements. What exile studies still have to
   do is render the results of decades of research into German-language
   exile from 1933 to 1945 usable for studies of contemporary migration
   and exile and to bring its area of study into line with new research
   approaches.
