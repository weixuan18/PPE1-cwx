Edward Snowden and 'How America Lost Its Secrets'

   New book dissects the complex image of Edward Snowden as hero versus
   villain and takes a close look at the vulnerability of US national
   security systems #Tucker

   Controversial whistleblower Edward Snowden, living in exile in Russia,
   said Monday he would like to return to the United States -- but only if
   he can get a fair jury trial.

   “That is the ultimate goal, but if I’m going to spend the rest of my
   life in prison then my one, bottom-line demand that we all have to
   agree to is that at least I get a fair trial,” Snowden said Monday on
   “CBS This Morning."

   Snowden told CBS’ morning show that the U.S. government has “refused”
   to guarantee a fair trial.

   “They won’t provide access to what’s called a public interest defense,”
   Snowden said.

   Co-host Tony Dokoupil said criminals don’t typically dictate terms of
   their trial.

   “They broke the law and they face the consequences,” Dokoupil said.
   “What makes you different?”

   Snowden fired back: “I’m not different. Again, I’m not asking for a
   parade. I’m not asking for a pardon. I’m not asking for a pass. What
   I’m asking for is a fair trial.”

   Snowden explained to the “CBS This Morning” panel that a jury would
   consider whether his actions were lawful or unlawful, as opposed to
   right or wrong.

   The infamous whistleblower said that he didn’t want to reside in Russia
   but was trapped there when the United States canceled his passport
   while he was traveling to Latin America.

   “I was just trying to continue on my journey into asylum,” he said.

   Gayle King pointed out that the “optics are not good” that he’s in
   Russia, and Snowden agreed.

   “You’re absolutely right and I’m on the same side,” he said. “Of course
   it’s problematic and of course I would like to return to the United
   States.”

   The ex-National Security Agency (NSA) contractor blew the lid off U.S.
   government surveillance methods in 2013. Moscow has resisted U.S.
   pressure to extradite Snowden, who faces charges that could land him in
   prison for up to 30 years.

   The Guardian in Britain published the first story based on Snowden's
   disclosures. It revealed that a secret court order was allowing the
   U.S. government to get Verizon to share the phone records of millions
   of Americans. Later stories, including those in The Washington Post,
   disclosed other snooping and how U.S. and British spy agencies had
   tapped into information from cables carrying the world's phone and
   Internet traffic.
