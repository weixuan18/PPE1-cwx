At home and in exile

We need to adequately plan for internal migration due to climate change

   At the height of the Syrian and Rohingya crises, much of the world’s
   attention turned to forced displacement and refugees. Both exemplified
   the typical conditions under which people are forcibly displaced: war,
   political persecution, economic instability and repression. Still, most
   of the world’s migration is internal, i.e. within the same country.
   Among the tens of millions displaced in 2015, 21.3 million were
   refugees, but 40.8 million were internally displaced. People usually
   change their homes to improve household income, for marriage or other
   purposes relating to family.

   With climate change, however, its worsening slow onset effects such as
   droughts, effects from sea level rise and water shortages will cause
   many more to leave their homes and move to safer places. Such migration
   may be a choice in the initial stages; for instance, a young member may
   travel to a city close by during a drought to increase his or her
   family’s income. But as the stress becomes more severe, the decision to
   move may be forced. The gradual rise in sea levels wherein people are
   compelled to leave their island nations in the Pacific and Indian
   Oceans and become climate exiles is one such ongoing process that will
   likely increase out-migration over time

   Why people move

   In “Groundswell: Preparing for Internal Climate Migration”, a recent
   report by the World Bank, it is estimated that in Latin America, South
   Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa over 143 million people would be forced to
   move within borders by 2050 as a result of slow onset climate events
   alone. In the worst-case scenario, about 40 million of these migrants
   would be in South Asia, which is the most populous of the regions
   studied, with a number of climate change effects anticipated.

   The report examines countries in East Africa, South Asia and Central
   America more closely. Here, it dives deep into the conditions in
   Ethiopia, Bangladesh and Mexico. Three possible scenarios are
   described: high greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions along with unequal
   development paths, regarded as the pessimistic reference scenario; an
   inclusive development scenario with high GHG emissions but development
   paths that improve access to services for the poor and consider their
   priorities and unmet needs; and a climate-friendly scenario involving
   lower GHG emissions but with unequal development.

   South Asia is characterised by rain-fed farmland in large parts of the
   region. With variability in the monsoons and warmer temperatures, crop
   failures will lead to migration from the Gangetic plains and from the
   rice-growing northeast of Bangladesh and the inundated coasts. In the
   pessimistic scenario, the numbers forced to move internally in South
   Asia are expected to increase six-fold between 2020 and 2050 and will
   continue to rise beyond 2050 without appropriate climate action. Even
   in the inclusive development and climate-friendly scenarios, tens of
   millions will be forced to migrate. While people normally gravitate to
   big cities, those along the coast such as Mumbai, Chennai, Chittagong
   and Dhaka will themselves be vulnerable to storm surges and other
   effects from sea level rise.

   The poor would be the worst affected by these slow onset events and
   most of them would migrate out of rural areas to nearby urban
   settlements, which would be cities and the peri-urban surroundings.
   Such “hotspots” of in and out migration would be stressed for natural
   resources, public services and livelihoods. In India, areas between
   Chennai and Bengaluru have been highlighted in the report along with
   those around Mexico City, Guatemala City and Nairobi. In India, there
   are already signs of unplanned and frontier-led growth in peri-urban
   areas. Past experience shows that planning that ignores the ecosystem
   services provided by local natural resources such as water tanks and
   forested areas generates further problems particularly for the poorest
   and most vulnerable.

   The implications of these internal migrations will be significant for
   development in the areas and for the lives of these people. Therefore,
   understanding migration patterns, getting better socioeconomic data on
   migration and preparing in advance through appropriate planning become
   critical. The scenarios used in the Bank report could be extended to
   cover other time periods and could also be more localised. Current
   climate modelling methods are not accurate at high resolutions for
   local decision-making, but these are expected to improve over time.

   What can be done?

   What kind of policies are needed? Reducing GHG emissions is of utmost
   urgency, although that seems to be taking place at a pace determined by
   geopolitical as well as local initiatives. Second, integrating internal
   migration with ongoing development planning is vital. The peri-urban
   areas, which are expected to be hot spots, already show problems of
   water shortage, waste management, nutritional deficiency, limited
   services such as health and education, and poor infrastructure.
   Ecosystems, part of the natural resources in peri-urban areas, ought to
   be protected as “special ecological zones”, so that as urban
   settlements expand, they don’t eat into ecosystem services. Skill
   building, job training and other opportunities for education and jobs
   for locals and migrants would also have to become a focal point. Rights
   for those who are forced to migrate would be fundamental in these
   preparations, as studies and experience have shown that ignoring issues
   of social justice and equity in adaptation can lead to serious
   governance failure.
