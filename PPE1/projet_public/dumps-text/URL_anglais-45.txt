Banishment from Paris of Germaine de Staël

   She was also an important political figure and was regarded by
   contemporary Europe as the personal enemy of Napoleon. With Constant
   and his friends she formed the nucleus of a liberal resistance that so
   embarrassed Napoleon that in 1803 he had her banished to a distance of
   40 miles (64 km) from Paris. Thenceforward Coppet was her headquarters,
   and in 1804 she began what she called, in a work published posthumously
   in 1821, her Dix Années d’exil (Ten Years’ Exile). From December 1803
   to April 1804 she made a journey through Germany, culminating in a
   visit to Weimar, already established as the shrine of J.W. von Goethe
   and Friedrich von Schiller. In Berlin she met August Wilhelm von
   Schlegel, who was to become, after 1804, her frequent companion and
   counselor. Her guide in Germany, however, was a young Englishman, Henry
   Crabb Robinson, who was studying at Jena. The journey was interrupted
   in 1804 by news of the death of her father, whom she had always greatly
   admired. His death affected her deeply, but in 1805 she set out for
   Italy, accompanied by Schlegel and Simonde de Sismondi, the Genevan
   economist who was her guide on the journey. Returning in June 1805, she
   spent the next seven years of her exile from Paris for the most part at
   Coppet.

   While Corinne can be considered the result of her Italian journey, the
   fruits of her visit to Germany are contained in her most important
   work, De l’Allemagne (1810; Germany). This is a serious study of German
   manners, literature and art, philosophy and morals, and religion in
   which she made known to her contemporaries the Germany of the Sturm und
   Drang movement (1770–1780). Its only fault is the distorted picture it
   gives, ignoring, for example, the violently nationalistic aspect of
   German Romanticism. Napoleon took it for an anti-French work, and the
   French edition of 1810 (10,000 copies) was seized and destroyed. It was
   finally published in England in 1813.

   Meanwhile Mme de Staël, persecuted by the police, fled from Napoleon’s
   Europe. Having married, in 1811, a young Swiss officer, “John” Rocca,
   in May 1812 she went to Austria and, after visiting Russia, Finland,
   and Sweden, arrived, in June 1813, in England. She was received with
   enthusiasm, although reproached by such liberals as Lord Byron for
   being more anti-Napoleonic than liberal and by the Tories for being too
   liberal. Her guide in England was Sir James Mackintosh, the Scottish
   publicist. She collected documents for, but never wrote, a De
   l’Angleterre: (the material for it can be found in the Considérations
   sur la Révolution française [1818; Considerations on the Principal
   Events of the French Revolution], which represents a return to Necker’s
   ideas and holds up the English political system as a model for France).

   On the Bourbon Restoration in 1814, Mme de Staël returned to Paris but
   was deeply disillusioned: the fall of Napoleon had been followed by
   foreign occupation and had in no way reestablished liberty in France.
   During the Hundred Days she escaped to Coppet and in September 1815 set
   out again for Italy. In 1816 she returned to spend the summer at
   Coppet, where she was joined by Byron, in flight from England after his
   unhappy matrimonial experience. A strong friendship developed between
   the two writers.

   Mme de Staël’s health was declining. After Byron’s departure she went
   to Paris for the winter. Though poorly received by the returned émigrés
   and suspected by the government, she held her salon throughout the
   winter and part of the spring, but after April 1817 she was an invalid.
   She died in Paris in July of that year.

Legacy

   Germaine de Staël’s purely literary importance is far exceeded by her
   importance in the history of ideas. Her novels and plays are now
   largely forgotten, but the value of her critical and historical work is
   undeniable. Though careless of detail, she had a clear vision of wider
   issues and of the achievements of civilization. Her involvement in, and
   understanding of, the events and tendencies of her time gave her an
   unusual position: it may be said that she helped the dawning 19th
   century to take stock of itself.
