Living conditions and everyday life in exile

     Ich bin immer noch dabei, mir eine neue Existenz aufzubauen, und da
     es zum vierten Male in meinem Leben ist, so faellt es nicht immer
     ganz leicht.

     [I am still in the process of establishing myself, and since this is
     the fourth time in my life, it’s not always easy. (ed. trans.)]


    Architect Franz Hillinger, employee of Bruno Taut in Turkey, in a
    letter from Canada to the governing Mayor of Berlin, Ernst Reuter,
    1951

   People who go into exile leave a lot behind, especially if they have to
   escape quickly. In their families, often the only ones who can follow
   are direct relatives like husbands/wives and children; possessions and
   social networks are left behind. In the receiving country, everyday
   life is characterised by immigration bureaucracy, difficulties
   adjusting, financial worries and language problems. This results in
   uncertainties and uprooting, because lifestyle habits are eliminated
   and the new start is uncertain.

   Hundreds of thousands of people who went into exile between 1933 and
   1945 had to face these everyday struggles, including an estimated
   10,000 artists and scientists. They were cut off from the professional
   contacts that they had established over time and faced the challenge of
   finding adequate work. A large number of exiles were thus reliant on
   financial assistance from friends and acquaintances, benefactors and
   aid organisations. The reports from exiles repeatedly mention the
   inconvenience of having to ask acquaintances for money. In October
   1940, author Mascha Kaléko wrote in her New York diary that she and
   other emigrants had no money, no friends, no connections and no hope.
   They didn’t have the money for public transport, or even shoes. She
   also wrote that she did not have medication for her son Stephen and
   that he faced being thrown out of school because they could not afford
   the fees. “Damn money. It is humiliating not to have any” she
   complained and added that so-called friends were already avoiding her
   and her family as if they were lepers. (cited according to Gisela
   Zoch-Westphal: Aus den sechs Leben der Mascha Kaléko [From the 6 lives
   of Mascha Kaléko], p. 117f.)

   In some cases, the wives of emigrants took on simple work and poorly
   paid jobs to secure their families’ survival with their income, while
   their husbands tried to get their careers going in the receiving
   country. However, this situation also enabled many women in exile to
   overcome traditional gender roles and have successful careers.

   More than a few emigrants complained about loneliness because social
   contacts and friendships were at times hard to establish in the
   receiving country. For many, social life consisted only of contacts to
   other exiles. In part, the societies in the receiving countries were
   suspicious of and rejected the refugees. These are problems still faced
   by exiles and refugees who have had to leave their home countries.
   Prejudices against foreigners and racism often make it harder to start
   over in a new culture.

   In some countries, emigrants encountered favourable conditions: Many an
   architect managed to advance his career in the USA, Palestine or
   Turkey. In Mexico, communist artists found a liberal climate that was
   politically sympathetic to the Soviet Union for a while.

   For people leaving the GDR from 1949 onwards, the Federal Republic made
   it easier to organise everyday life in many ways. The post-War society
   in the Federal Republic offered them political freedom of expression
   and gave them the opportunity to succeed economically, and there was no
   language problem in the divided Germany. Public debate about cultural
   identity and integration also continued in Germany as a receiving
   country. However, differences between cultures that are brought along
   and which exist in the new place cannot be overcome by political
   programmes; they are an existential experience for those affected by
   them.
