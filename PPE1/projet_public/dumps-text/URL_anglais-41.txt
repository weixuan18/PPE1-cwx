Working and being productive in exile

     Das waren die Emigranten: der Prokurist aus Bielefeld, der dachte,
     er hätte Aussichten auf eine Stellung in einem großen Warenhaus. Da
     war der bekannte Rechtsanwalt aus Berlin, der träumte von einem
     Angebot eines Konzerns. Den berühmten Herzspezialisten erwartete
     eine umfangreiche Praxis. Der Schriftsteller glaubte einen Kontrakt
     in der Tasche zu haben, der ihm die Aufführung seines Stückes auf
     dem Broadway sicherte. Da war der große Schauspieler, dem die
     Karriere in Hollywood winkte.

     Aber es kam anders, ganz anders.

     [They were typical of many emigrants. The businessman from
     Bielefeld, who believed he had good chances of gaining employment in
     a large department store. Then there was the famous lawyer from
     Berlin, who dreamed of receiving an offer from a large company. The
     well-known heart specialist expected to take on his own surgery. The
     author who believed he had a good connection that would secure him a
     run on Broadway. And then there was also the great actor who was
     just waiting for Hollywood to call.

     But things turned out differently, very differently. (ed. trans.)]


    Alice Herdan-Zuckmayer, Die Farm in den grünen Bergen, 1949

   Our image of the artist living in exile is often associated with the
   names of successful and well-known figures. But this is misleading,
   because making it as an artist in exile means overcoming a great many
   hurdles and many don’t make it.

   For artists in particular, the circumstances in which they can produce
   their art in exile are completely new. They depend on a market for
   their art, on a public and on public tastes. They need people who
   support them, people like gallery directors and publishers who can
   distribute their work or public events like concerts or theatre
   performances. In many cases, going into exile meant finding a new
   public, writing in the language of the receiving country and adapting
   to the market conditions there. It is difficult for artists to find
   their way into and around the art business in a receiving country
   because the marketability of art works depends on a number of factors.
   How artistic quality is assessed can differ from country to country and
   praise from the critics is by no means a guarantee for economic success
   or recognition within a certain culture. The combination of country of
   origin and receiving country and the issue of a shared cultural
   heritage are also matters of significance in this respect.

   In addition to this, artists face the problem or challenge of gaining
   access to the art business in the receiving country. Many aspects play
   a role here, which do not necessarily have anything to do with artistic
   quality: for example, being able to adapt to certain customs and the
   new language, being able to gain access to important places and having
   the right contacts.

   Only seldom are artists able to continue their work where they left
   off, and they often have to prioritise commissioned work over artistic
   independence. There are numerous examples of this among those who were
   forced to live in exile outside of the Nazi sphere of influence from
   1933 to 1945: one political graphic designer, for instance, worked as a
   book designer for travel guides, while many critical writers ended up
   writing scripts for Hollywood and Jewish actors even played Nazis in
   American anti-Nazi propaganda films. At the same time, networks and
   mutual support among those living in exile were vital to continuing
   their artistic work. By setting up their own publishing houses and
   other channels for publication as well as cultural associations, those
   in exile also created structures that helped against isolation and
   aimed to provide them with employment opportunities and publicity in
   the receiving countries. However, going into exile can also lead
   artists to cease their previous artistic activities completely. If
   artists are unable to find a way into the cultural scene in their exile
   country, for example, they may have no choice but to take on any kind
   of work just to earn a living and survive.

   The impact of exile and migration on the artistic process also gives
   rise to a great many questions when we look at contemporary artists
   living in exile; for example, how easy it is for artists to enter and
   find acceptance in the cultural scene of the receiving country.
