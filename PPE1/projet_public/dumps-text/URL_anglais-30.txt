   Every year, dozens of journalists are forced to leave their homes under
   threat of imprisonment, torture, violence, or even death, because their
   work has angered the powerful. Over the past 12 months, the Committee
   to Protect Journalists has supported 42 journalists around the world
   who were forced to flee, with Syria, Ethiopia, and Eritrea responsible
   for the most cases of exile. These are some of their stories.

   Most of the journalists CPJ has assisted in exile had little or no
   warning that they would be forced to flee, to undertake a journey of
   trauma and uncertainty. While their experiences have much in common
   with ordinary refugees, CPJ research shows that journalists’ high
   profiles leave them particularly vulnerable to certain dangers and that
   the persecution they faced at home often follows them across borders.
   Furthermore, the media community left behind is often intimidated into
   self-censorship and the public deprived of information. CPJ is
   releasing its annual survey of journalists in exile to mark World
   Refugee Day, June 20.

   While each journalist in exile has a unique tale to tell, every
   reporter, broadcaster, photojournalist, videographer, editor, blogger,
   and media worker forced to flee experiences similar dangers and must
   overcome similar milestones to reach any new semblance of normal life.
   This timeline looks in detail at the journeys into exile of eight
   journalists from around the world who fled their homes in recent years
   and sought support from CPJ. All of their comments are from interviews
   with the organization.

The Journalism

   Some exiled journalists become targets after publishing or broadcasting
   one sensitive story. CPJ research shows that such stories are usually
   on politics, corruption, crime, war, or violence.

   Iran Iran

   In 2010, an Iranian investigative reporter and photographer, who did
   not wish to be named in order to protect his security, began
   interviewing the families of protesters killed or arrested during the
   demonstrations that followed Iran’s 2009 disputed presidential
   election. While conducting the interviews for a documentary, the
   journalist received a series of anonymous telephone calls inquiring
   about the film and accusing him of having ties to the foreign press, he
   said. At least one caller threatened the journalist’s family.

   “They told me to stop working for the media, because working for the
   media would cause further headaches for me. The caller said ‘…You want
   to be safe, don’t you? You want your family to be safe, don’t you? All
   kinds of things could happen when people step out onto the street.’ He
   told me not to work for the media until further notice.”

   Omwa Ombara Omwa Ombara

   Kenyan freelance reporter Grace Ombara covered politics and was admired
   for her integrity-she refused to accept a bribe from a local politician
   seeking favorable news coverage. She wrote about corruption in the 2007
   election and the ensuing violence that killed 1,200 people. Later, she
   was approached by the International Criminal Court (ICC) as a potential
   witness in the court’s investigation into the deadly aftermath of the
   vote.

   After word got out that Ombara had been approached by the court to
   testify, the journalist began receiving threats. These escalated from
   ominous calls and text messages to unidentified individuals following
   her in the street.

   Other journalists endure years of harassment and threats in response to
   their work before the persecution escalates to the point that they feel
   they have no choice but to flee.

   Mir Zabibhullah, an experienced Afghan reporter who began working when
   he was 15 years old, started investigating and reporting on crimes of
   war in 2007. The journalist said he received threats during this time,
   but nothing that scared him enough to stop his work.

   In 2013, when Zabibhullah, now in his mid-thirties, began to focus on
   warlords running for government positions, the harassment escalated.
   “As a journalist who was completely aware of the situation and had
   evidence, it was my responsibility to write about it. I couldn’t stop
   myself,” he said.

   On October 19, 2013, Zabibhullah’s articles on warlords appeared in the
   Afghanistan Monitor newspaper, in print and online, as well as on the
   Ariana Television Network.

   When Zabibhullah received a threatening call that same day, he did not
   take his assailants seriously at first. He said he had accepted that
   such warnings were a normal part of journalism in Afghanistan, and he
   was determined not to let them prevent him from working.

The Decision To Leave

   Fear of physical retaliation is the main reason journalists give for
   fleeing their homes. About half of the 404 journalists whom CPJ has
   assisted over the past five years cited fear of violence as their
   reason for leaving. In fact, Somalia, Syria, and Sri Lanka, which
   account for a quarter of CPJ’s exiled assistance cases, are all ranked
   among the top five countries on CPJ’s Impunity Index, which spotlights
   countries where journalists are murdered regularly and their killers go
   free.

   On October 19, 2013, the same day that Zabibhullah’s most recent
   articles on corruption were published, he received a phone call
   demanding he hand over all his work, including notes and documents. He
   responded by asking how he should go about doing so, in an effort to
   find out who was calling. The line went dead, and Zabib turned off his
   phone and continued with his scheduled meetings for that day. He turned
   his phone back on hours later to find numerous missed calls from an
   unknown number, as well as calls from his boss and his mother.

   The journalist was told that armed men claiming to be from the
   government had come to the office looking for him. Zabibhullah’s boss
   asked him to work from home and avoid the office for his safety.

   When Zabibhullah spoke about calling his mother, his voice cracked as
   he described the feeling of hearing his mother cry for the first time
   in his life. He explained, through sobs, how he found out that men in
   military uniform came to his home searching for him. They entered the
   house and demanded to see where Zabibhullah kept his documents. In
   front of his wife and small children, they started a fire, destroying
   all his work.

   The men left, and his wife tried to put out the fire. With difficulty,
   Zabibhullah described how he arrived at the hospital to find his wife’s
   arms and face bandaged because of the severe burns she had suffered.
   “It was the worst experience of my entire life,” he said.

   That night, Zabibhullah fled with his wife and two children to
   Pakistan.

   “I have to leave my homeland, the country that I love, my home, my
   career that I love,” he said.

   The other most common reason cited by journalists for fleeing is fear
   of imprisonment. Two countries who consistently jail journalists for
   their work, Iran and Ethiopia, are responsible for sending into exile
   about a quarter of the journalists CPJ has assisted over the past five
   years.

   Despite continued threats and legal harassment in reaction to her
   reports on government corruption, Frederica Jansz had no intention of
   ever leaving Sri Lanka. She had spent 20 years working as a journalist,
   building a career as a dogged newspaper reporter.

   In July 2012, Jansz’ lawyers told her there was a good chance that her
   passport would be confiscated by the court and that she could face jail
   time because Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the defense secretary (and brother of
   the president), was pursing court action against her.

   The Sunday Leader newspaper,where Jansz was editor-in-chief, had
   published an article alleging the misuse of government funds by
   Rajapaksa. In response, Rajapaksa revived a contempt of court action he
   had filed in 2009 after Jansz reported critically on the government.
   Jansz said that Rajapaksa also threatened and cursed her over the phone
   when she had called to inquire about the use of government funds.
   Still, Jansz did not consider leaving her home or her career-even
   though her predecessor as editor-in-chief, Lasantha Wickramatunga, had
   been murdered on his way to work on January 8, 2009. (Nobody has been
   prosecuted for the crime.)

   Even when the United States ambassador called her and advised her to
   leave the country, Jansz responded, “I’m not going anywhere.” The
   journalist had been offered a multiple-entry visa to the U.S. after
   receiving threats in 2009. “I was shocked. I had no intention of using
   it. I did not want to leave,” she said.

   In September 2012, Jansz was fired from her position at the Sunday
   Leader, but Rajapaksa threatened to continue with litigation against
   her in her private capacity. Soon after losing her job, Jansz said, she
   was followed home by men on motorbikes on at least two occasions.

   Terrified, Jansz decided that now she had no choice.

   “In the end, I had to go-not for me, but for my children,” she said.

   Quietly and without saying goodbye to anyone, the journalist packed
   some clothes and boarded a plane with her children for the U.S.

   One month after Jansz arrived in the U.S., the Sri Lankan Court of
   Appeals issued a warrant for her arrest.

Where to Go

   Once journalists realize they have no choice but to flee, many seek
   initial refuge in a neighboring country, where the border is easy to
   cross and visa requirements minimal or nil. From there, they register
   as refugees with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
   (UNHCR) or with the appropriate government agency, with the aim of
   being formally resettled, usually to a third country. But the
   registration process is often long and cumbersome.

   The procedure in each country varies, and the rules can change
   mid-stream, further compounding confusion. Even after a journalist has
   successfully registered as a refugee, the date they receive for their
   resettlement interview is often one or two years in the future. And it
   is nearly impossible for exiled journalists to receive updates on the
   status of their case.

   Iran Iran

   One Eritrean journalist, a producer at the state-run Radio Bana, whose
   name CPJ is withholding to protect his safety, was detained in December
   2012, two days after he spoke at a conference on reporting he had
   conducted on the educational system in Eritrea and how it marginalized
   and isolated the minority ethnic Bilen community, which is not taught
   Tigrinya, the national language.

   After the producer was arrested at his home in Asmara, Eritrea’s
   capital, he said, he was taken to prison and accused of harboring
   anti-state feelings and of spying; he was hung upside down and tied up
   while officers beat his legs. Eritrea is Africa’s worst jailer of
   journalists and the world’s worst abuser of due process, according to
   CPJ research; no Eritrean journalist detainee has ever been publicly
   charged with a crime or brought before a court for trial.

   When the producer was released from prison six months later, he was
   summoned by the Ministry of Defense to report for service-an indefinite
   assignment in Eritrea. A trusted friend in the ministry told the
   journalist that a letter had been received that said, “We are
   transferring this person to your unit because he has sub-nationalistic
   feelings. Keep watch on him.”

   Fearing for his life, the producer traveled to the remote village where
   his parents lived. He kept a low profile for seven months, until his
   father was approached by a village administrator who asked why his son
   had returned. The journalist then fled on foot to Sudan, stopping only
   briefly to say goodbye to his wife and children. The journey took him a
   week.

   Sudanese police patrol regularly to round up Eritreans trying to cross
   the border. “If you pay them, you will be released,” the journalist
   said. “If you’re wanted by the Eritrean government though, they may
   turn you over.”

   The journalist believed his name would be recognized; he was terrified
   of being stopped and sent back to prison. Even in Khartoum, Sudan’s
   capital, he felt unsafe surrounded by so many exiled Eritreans. “I did
   not know who to trust,” he said. He traveled by car and on foot to
   South Sudan, passing several checkpoints and bribing officers to let
   him pass, before reaching the White Nile river and boarding a boat for
   a five-day journey to Juba, the capital. The entire trip took two
   weeks, but the journalist’s journey is not over. There is no UNHCR
   office in South Sudan, so he will have to cross another border if he
   wants to register as a refugee and apply for resettlement.

   Some journalists have the means to travel directly to the country where
   they intend to apply for asylum, eliminating the UNHCR resettlement
   process. Still, they are not usually able to immediately settle down
   and restart their lives. They must begin the lengthy, and sometimes
   expensive, process of applying for asylum.

   Once in Pakistan, the Afghan reporter Zabibhullah paid a smuggler
   US$20,000 to help him escape. He was taken to Karachi, where he boarded
   a flight to Dubai, where he was given a passport. He then flew to
   Denmark and eventually made his way to Landskrona, a small town in
   southern Sweden, where he is now.

   But Zabibhullah left his wife and children behind in Pakistan, where he
   believed they would be safer than they would in the care of a smuggler.
   Zabibhullah said he hopes to bring his family to Sweden as soon as he
   is granted asylum, but in the meantime he cannot find work and has
   struggled with anxiety, depression, and guilt concerning his family.
   “It tortures me that I put them in that situation,” he said.

   In yet another scenario, some journalists are deported from their home
   country after being released from prison.

   Rodríguez Saludes Rodríguez Saludes

   Cuban photographer Omar Rodríguez Saludes served seven years of a
   27-year prison sentence. He was arrested in 2003, along with 28 other
   reporters and editors, during a massive crackdown on Cuba’s independent
   press-a period known as the “Black Spring.” In 2010, after negotiations
   with the Catholic Church and the Spanish government, Cuban President
   Raúl Castro agreed to release 52 political dissidents, including
   journalists, on the condition that they leave Cuba for Spain
   immediately. The day he was let out of prison, Rodríguez Saludes was
   put on a plane to Europe.

   “Leaving Cuba was the most painful process,” Rodríguez Saludes said.
   “It was very traumatic. I felt my life was being ripped out. From one
   day to another you are in a prison cell and then you are in Spain. At
   first, I didn’t want anything to do with this. But the Cuban state
   security was smart and they used my family. They brought them to speak
   to me, and I had no choice. … And it was so difficult to go from a
   place where you don’t even see the grass grow to a plane where the
   entire crew is welcoming you to freedom.

   “There were so many police taking me onto the plane. There were even
   police officers on the stairs leading up to the aircraft. And then, on
   the plane, the Iberia crew was waiting to welcome me. They welcomed me
   back to freedom and to democracy. After living so long alone, it was
   very emotional to be welcomed into freedom. As soon as the plane took
   off, the captain announced that [I] and another independent journalist
   were on the plane-that we had been in prison and were now on our way to
   freedom. I will never forget that day.”

New Country, New Hardships

   Once journalists who cross the border into a neighboring country have
   registered as refugees, they can apply for resettlement to a third
   country. CPJ data show that nearly 60 percent of journalists assisted
   over the past 12 months went through this process in a country of first
   refuge.

   As they wait among the community of refugees from their own country,
   journalists are extremely vulnerable because their work has made them
   recognizable. In many cases, journalists in exile continue to be
   targeted by their home governments, whose agents infiltrate refugee
   communities abroad. In some cases, home governments target the
   journalist’s family left behind. And in other cases, insurgent groups
   who forced journalists to flee in the first place continue to threaten
   and attack them, especially if the journalists keep reporting on
   sensitive topics.

   Abdifatah Elmi Abdifatah Elmi

   In August 2008, Somali photojournalist and cameraman Abdifatah Elmi was
   working as a fixer with Canadian reporter Amanda Lindhout and
   Australian photographer Nigel Brennan in a refugee camp outside
   Mogadishu when they were kidnapped at gunpoint. Abdifatah was held for
   nearly five months before being released with threats to not to discuss
   his kidnapping or continue reporting. (The international journalists
   were held for 15 months.) Abdifatah said he was told, “If we miss you
   when you are let out, your family is here.” Realizing he would not be
   able to safely continue his work in Somalia, he fled to Kenya, leaving
   behind his wife and four children.

   Abdifatah described his fears as a Somali refugee in Nairobi, where he
   continues to try to make his living as a journalist. In March 2014, six
   months after the attack on the city’s Westgate Mall that killed 67
   people, Kenya’s Ministry of Interior ordered all refugees to be
   relocated to refugee camps, a dangerous location for exiled
   journalists, CPJ research shows. “[Refugee] camps are not safe because
   there is no security, no police,” Abdifatah said. “Everyone knows who
   you are.” He and others in Kenya say the militant insurgent group
   Al-Shabaab, believed to be responsible for the murders of many Somali
   journalists at home, has penetrated the camps. Ethiopian journalists
   exiled to Kenya are also targeted by the directive; they fear the
   presence of Ethiopian security agents in the camps.

   At least 21 Somali and Ethiopian journalists were arrested in Nairobi
   during March and April 2014, according to CPJ research. Most used the
   little money they had to bribe their way out of the camps.

   “I can’t go anywhere. I can’t go to the camps, I can’t go back to
   Somalia. This is the worst situation,” Abdifatah said. “Every night, in
   the middle of the night, they knock on doors. You can’t sleep-you can’t
   imagine.”

   Only 28 percent of refugee applicants were granted resettlement to a
   third country in 2013, according to data made public by the UNHCR.
   Those granted resettlement, including journalists, may still wait
   several months to several years to reach their destination, depending
   on the demand for assistance.

   Iran Iran

   The Iranian journalist who was threatened after interviewing the
   families of killed protesters, fled Iran in August 2012. He arrived in
   Turkey on a Sunday. On Monday, he went to the UNHCR office in Ankara
   and stood in line outside to submit a request for resettlement. “We
   waited it out until the afternoon,” he said. “They took our passports
   and returned [them] to us an hour later with two sheets of paper. In
   one of the papers was written an introduction to the city police
   department.” He said the second paper stated they would be considered
   for enrollment in six months.

   Finding a place to live was difficult. The journalist did not speak the
   local language and tried to communicate in English, a language he did
   not know well. He went with his family to the police department whose
   address they had been given; after being interviewed, they received a
   temporary residence card. One week later, he was able to rent an
   apartment.

   In December 2012, the Iranian journalist and his family had their first
   interview with the UNHCR and were officially registered as refugees.
   Almost a year later, in October 2013, his family was interviewed for
   resettlement.

   He said, “All this time, my wife and I, as two journalists, were almost
   secretly living in Turkey. We never had comfort and confidence to
   continue our jobs in Turkey because I would prefer that none of our
   former colleagues in Iran know our location.” He said he believes one
   of his colleagues informed the secret service in Iran of his
   activities. Even though he is out of the country, he still feels
   vulnerable-a common sentiment among Iranian journalists in exile,
   according to CPJ research.

   The journalist has continued to record videos for an Iranian newswire,
   but he does not use his real name. “I even got verbal warning a few
   times from the Turkish police to stop any activity on movies and news
   videos, because they are afraid of my camera and they think I am
   engaged in political activities against the Turkey government,” he
   said.

   Exiled journalists who go straight to the country where they apply for
   asylum also go through a difficult waiting period. Some journalists try
   to continue working while finding their footing in a new country, only
   to find that they face persecution by authorities in that country as
   well.

   mohamed_al-aweid mohamed_al-aweid

   Mohamed al-Aweid is an experienced journalist who served as the
   regional director of the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) in
   the city of Daraa and reported for the official national daily Syrian
   Baath Newspaper. He was detained because of his reporting in June 2011
   and again in May 2012, and accused of sharing secrets with the
   political opposition outside the country. After being released the
   second time, the journalist, fearing more harassment and prison time,
   fled Syria.

   Al-Aweid went to Jordan, where he registered as a refugee with the
   UNHCR and was directed to the Zaatari refugee camp. After several
   months there, al-Aweid bribed a security official to be allowed to
   leave the camp. He went to Amman, the capital, to continue his work as
   a journalist-first as an editor, then as a presenter for the TV channel
   Syria Al-Shaab, an opposition outlet that broadcasts via satellite and
   the Internet. He also reported for the opposition news website Zaman
   Altawasol. But several months after al-Aweid began appearing on TV,
   Jordanian intelligence officers summoned him and warned him that in
   Jordan he was a refugee and not a journalist, and that if he continued
   to work he would be sent back to Syria.

   Forced to stop working, al-Aweid had no income and no way to support
   his family. He began to look for another destination. In June 2013 he
   filed an asylum claim for his family at the French embassy in Jordan.

   Journalists who flee into exile sometimes arrive with no support
   network to cushion the fall of landing suddenly in a foreign country.

   Omwa Ombara Omwa Ombara

   Ombara, the Kenyan journalist who was threatened after being approached
   by the International Criminal Court about testifying on post-election
   violence, did not intend initially to come to the U.S. At first, she
   sought refuge with a friend; then she moved into a safe house for
   witnesses set up by the Kenyan Witness Protection Agency. But when word
   leaked that she might testify, the ICC said she could no longer be a
   witness in its investigation-which meant she no longer qualified for
   the government’s protection. But the threats did not subside.

   Ombara fled to the U.S. in February 2013 and stayed briefly with
   friends in Washington D.C. before moving to Pennsylvania, where a
   relative lived. In June 2013, having no place to stay after her
   relative’s home proved too small, Ombara entered a women’s shelter,
   where she lived for the next six months. During this time, the
   journalist had her passport and wallet stolen. “It is not what I
   expected of America,” she said.

   She is now out of the shelter and applying for asylum in the U.S., but
   is frustrated by not being able to work and earn money. “For a
   professional like me, to become destitute, you don’t know what to do. …
   I never had to ask for help to buy soap. I used to give away soap. It
   is humiliating for me to ask.”

   “To make things worse, the people who put you through this are going on
   with their life,” Ombara said.

   One of the worst factors of exile for journalists is the difficulty of
   continuing their career. Even once they have documentation allowing
   employment, language is a barrier for many. About 20% of journalists
   assisted by CPJ have continued to work in journalism after going into
   exile.

   Rodríguez Saludes Rodríguez Saludes

   Rodríguez Saludes, the Cuban photographer who arrived in Spain in July
   2011, struggled to support himself and his family. He has since
   relocated to the U.S. and lives in Houston, Texas, with his wife and
   three children.

   “I’ve not really tried to get in touch with media here. I don’t really
   know why. Maybe it’s a complex I have because I don’t speak good
   English. At first, I ran those errands. I went to [Spanish-language TV
   network] Univisión, and I filled out an application. But I was quickly
   overwhelmed by the need to find a job, to make ends meet, so that fell
   by the wayside when I was able to find work at a hotel helping put
   together events.

   “There is a large Cuban community in Houston, but it’s not tight. I
   mostly see five people who were part of the Group of 75 [Cuban
   dissidents arrested during the Black Spring] and live in Houston. We
   are in touch and we stay together. … It’s harder with the rest of the
   community in Houston. Most of the Cubans who are here are interested in
   redoing their lives. Their thinking is very different from ours. We
   still think about Cuba and forming a new democratic country, freeing
   Cuba. They are mostly thinking about working and making money that they
   can then send back to Cuba.”

An Uncertain Future

   Exile is an enduring condition. In most cases, journalists who flee
   their countries do not have a clear vision of the future until many
   years later. Though none will ever be at home, some journalists are
   granted asylum and are able to rebuild their lives.

   Jansz, from Sri Lanka, received asylum in the U.S. exactly one year
   after submitting her application. “Despite the nightmare that was the
   last two years, I love my country,” she said recently. “I dreamt about
   it every night and cried.” …

   “It took me 20 years to get to where I was in my career. I am 46 [and]
   starting over.”

   Zabibhullah, the journalist forced to flee Afghanistan, said,

   “I was just trying to help other people who are victims and now what is
   happening is that I am a victim and my family is suffering somewhere
   else in the world.”

   He is waiting for his asylum application to be approved in Sweden.

   Omwa Ombara Omwa Ombara

   Ombara, the Kenyan journalist living in Pennsylvania, is waiting to
   hear if she has been granted asylum in the U.S. She said she wishes she
   could meet other journalists who have come to the country before her,
   but at the same time she is wary of other Kenyans in her city, not
   knowing whom she can trust. But the biggest struggle has been finding a
   way to survive:

   “How do you move on when you can’t work?”

   In December 2013, al-Aweid, the Syrian, was granted asylum in France,
   but the cost of transporting his family was his responsibility. He was
   able to buy plane tickets with the support of CPJ and partner
   organizations, and arrived in February 2014. He said images of the
   Syrian war haunt him and that “life remains difficult despite all the
   beautiful things because half of our souls remain in Syria.” Still, his
   children are attending school, the family is learning French, and
   Syrian acquaintances in France are helping them adapt to the new
   country.

   METHODOLOGY: CPJ’s annual exile report counts only cases who have been
   supported by the organization’s Journalist Assistance Program. CPJ uses
   this research, combined with expert analysis, to identify global
   trends. The survey includes only journalists who fled due to
   work-related persecution, who remained in exile for at least three
   months, and whose current whereabouts and activities are known to CPJ.
   The survey does not include the many journalists and media workers who
   leave their countries for professional opportunities, or to flee
   general violence, or those who were targeted for activities other than
   journalism, such as political activism.
