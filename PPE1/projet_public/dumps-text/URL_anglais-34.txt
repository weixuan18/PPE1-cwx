   Torture. Denial of medical care. Repeated interrogations and
   accusations of collaborating with enemies: Yemeni journalist Youssef
   Ajlan’s story of his detention, which lasted over a year, hews closely
   to those of many journalists imprisoned for their work.

   This month, CPJ published its annual prison census, which found that
   governments around the world are holding at least 262 journalists
   behind bars for their reporting.

   But CPJ never listed Ajlan on the census, because he wasn’t jailed by
   an internationally recognized government and therefore wasn’t covered
   under our methodology. Rather, he was detained by the Ansar Allah
   movement, commonly known as the Houthis–technically, a non-state actor.

   Yet the Houthis have detained dozens of journalists and are currently
   holding at least 13, according to CPJ research. If the Houthis were
   considered a governing authority, Yemen would have the fifth highest
   number of journalists in jail in the world, after Eritrea and ahead of
   Azerbaijan and Vietnam.

   The effect on the climate for media, and the flow of information to the
   public, is the same, whether the entity enforcing such brute censorship
   is an internationally recognized government or not. The Houthis’
   detentions of journalists has silenced those who wouldn’t toe the line,
   according to one freelance Yemeni journalist who asked not to be
   identified for security reasons.

   “My colleagues and I think that there [is] no real reporting from
   inside the capital or anywhere Houthis are controlling,” the freelance
   journalist said.

   CPJ has documented how all sides in Yemen’s conflict commit abuses
   against journalists, and how the disintegration of state structures and
   accountability have further amplified the threats. The freelance
   journalist told CPJ that in addition to being attacked by the Houthis,
   he received criticism online from the Houthis’ opponents — members of
   the government run by President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi and based in
   Aden.

   The Houthis have risen from a rebel group based in the mountainous
   north to controlling the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, and effectively taking
   over what remained of the Yemeni national government. After
   consolidating their hold on Sanaa in September 2014, the group seized
   control of the main intelligence and security agencies, including the
   National Security Bureau and the Political Security Organization –which
   according to a report to the U.N. Security Council were competing yet
   feared instruments of state control under former President Ali Abdullah
   Saleh (Hadi’s predecessor, who was killed this month). Then they
   started detaining journalists.

   On June 9, 2015, nine journalists were detained at the same time when
   Houthi fighters raided a Sanaa hotel where they had gathered because it
   offered electricity and internet access:
     * Abdulkhaleq Amran, Islah Online
     * Hesham Tarmoum, Mareb Press newspaper
     * Hareth Hameed, Al-RabeaNet news website
     * Akram al-Waleedi, Al-RabeaNet news website
     * Essam Balghaith, Nass FM radio station
     * Hisham al-Yousifi, Yemen Tube website
     * Haitham al-Shihab, Al-Ahali newspaper
     * Hassan Anaab, Yemen Shabab TV channel
     * Tawfiq al-Mansouri, Al-Masdar newspaper

   According to Mwatana Organization for Human Rights, an independent
   human rights NGO based in Sanaa, these nine are being held in a Sanaa
   prison run by the Political Security Organization and their cases were
   transferred to a criminal court on June 17, 2017.

   Since then, the Houthis have detained four more journalists, including:
     * Salah Al-Qaedy, of Suhail TV channel, on Aug 28, 2015, held in the
       Political Security Organization’s Sanaa prison
     * Hussein Saeed Al-Easi, of Nahthat Watan newspaper, on Feb 18,2016,
       held in the Sanaa al-Thawra Temporary Prison
     * Abdullah Al-Munifi, of Al-Sahwa net news website, on Feb 18,2016,
       held in the Sanaa al-Thawra Temporary Prison
     * Abdel-Raheem Mohsin, who freelanced for a number of outlets such as
       news websites Al-Hadath and Yemen Voice, on August 24, 2017. CPJ
       was unable to determine where Mohsin is being held.

   CPJ was not able to determine the status of those four cases under the
   Houthi-controlled institutions.

   Ajlan, who had worked as a reporter for the newspaper and news website
   Al-Masdar from 2008 until 2015, was arrested October 16, 2016 and
   released November 23, 2017. He told CPJ that he was beaten and subject
   to ill-treatment, particularly during the first month of his detention;
   his Houthi captors questioned him repeatedly, punched and kicked him,
   and beat him with a stick all over his body. He said they later tied
   his arms and legs to an iron rod and suspended him from between two
   desks.

   “They asked me about my work as a journalist and my contact with
   journalists outside the country,” Ajlan said. He said he had been
   detained by the Houthis for several hours on March 26, 2015, and had
   stopped working in media after this first detention.

   Ajlan said he was held in six different locations, and suffered from
   stomach ailments and urinary tract infections but was denied access to
   medical care, forcing his family to bring him medication prescribed by
   doctors outside of prison. Houthi authorities often barred his family
   from visits, he said.

   CPJ could not independently verify Ajlan’s account of his treatment in
   detention. CPJ emailed Mohammad Abdulsalam, spokesman for the Ansar
   Allah movement, with questions about the treatment of journalists in
   areas under the group’s control, but has not received a response.

   “Even though I told them that I had stopped working as a journalist and
   had bought a taxi in order to support my family, they rejected
   everything I said and accused me of being an agent for Saudi and
   American aggression,” Ajlan said, referring to his second detention of
   over a year.

   Aside from the arrests, there is the disappearance of journalist Waheed
   al-Sufi, the editor-in-chief of the Yemeni weekly al-Arabiya. Al-Sufi
   was abducted by unidentified gunmen in Sanaa on April 6, 2015, while
   paying the newspaper’s bills at the post office, and his whereabouts
   are unknown. There has been no verified claim of responsibility, and
   the Houthis have denied responsibility, but the kidnapping happened in
   Sanaa, where the Houthis exercise control.

   Instead of investigating al-Sufi’s disappearance, the Houthis have
   continued to obstruct and detain journalists. For example, on December
   2, they seized the TV channel Yemen Today’s office and held dozens of
   employees hostage until December 13. Many journalists have fled for
   areas under the control of the government in Aden. Under Houthi
   control, the environment is a combination of the hollow shell of
   Saleh’s authoritarian rule of law with the rebel rule of the gun.
   Silence or exile are the only options.
