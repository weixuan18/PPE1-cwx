Reasons and causes of exile

     3 Fragen: 1) Kann ich in Deutschland noch schreiben, wozu es mich
     treibt? 2) Kann ich in D. leben ohne denen in [den] Rücken zu
     fallen, die das nicht mehr können, moral[isch] genommen? 3) Kann ich
     mich in D. ernähren?

     [3 questions: 1) Can I still write about what moves me in Germany?
     2) Can I still live in G. without betraying those who can no longer
     do that, from a moral perspective? 3) Can I sustain myself in G.?
     (ed. trans.)]


    Arnold Zweig on March 18, 1933 in his pocket diary
     __________________________________________________________________

   There are different reasons for going into exile depending on the
   individual fate, but they are usually related to lack of freedom and
   human rights, suppression and persecution by state authorities. Most of
   the people who have to leave their home country have been politically
   persecuted or have even had their lives threatened by a regime. For
   others, political measures make it impossible to work in their
   profession, for example, due to racist discrimination. In addition,
   there are a large number of refugees who have to flee their countries
   due to armed conflicts and hunger. Today, more than 15 million people
   are considered refugees as defined by international law.

   Artists are also affected by the fate of flight and migration: Art is
   often critical of those in power and the living conditions in a
   society.  This makes artists in dictatorial countries a target for
   state suppression. Others leave their country to be able to realise
   their own form of art for which there is no audience under the
   political conditions in their home country. Looking for freedom of
   expression and options to develop artistically, many artists also come
   to Germany these days, after the 20th century and in particular the
   Nazi era had forced an unparalleled exodus of artists and
   intellectuals.

   Immediately after they assumed power in 1933, the Nazis started to
   centrally control cultural institutions such as museums, operas and
   theatres, as well as educational institutions like universities and
   arts academies. Artistic productions were censored, modern and
   avant-garde artistry was denounced as “depraved”, disliked persons were
   forced out of their positions and professions. In the spring of 1933,
   the Nazis already organised several book burnings of works by authors
   that the regime despised and casted out for racist, political or
   aesthetic reasons. The Gestapo persecuted political artists who were
   close to social democrats or communists. Many of these artists and
   members of these two parties were the first to leave the country.

   The Nazi regime used racial discrimination laws to force Jewish artists
   out of public life and take away their rights one by one. The Nazis
   denied Jews the ability to create art in general. From 1938, after the
   November pogroms, many Jews emigrated from the German Reich – for many
   this was their last chance to save themselves by escaping.

   The GDR government also limited artistic freedom: There was no
   immediate risk to life for those who rejected having their art directed
   by the state, but the Stasi arrested artists or the state authorities
   took away their ability to work, e.g. by excluding them from artistic
   associations, censorship or banning them from their occupations.
   Before the Wall was erected, artists and many others left the GDR for
   the Federal Republic of Germany as the reinforcement of the border made
   it more difficult to leave the country. Others were expatriated as
   disliked artists even though they did not actually want to leave the
   GDR.
