American Exile

   Rapid Deportations That Bypass the Courtroom

   American Exile Report

   American Exile Report

   The majority of people deported from the United States each year are
   never given a chance to have their claims heard in court. People denied
   of their due process rights include asylum seekers, children, people
   with mental disabilities, U.S. citizens, and people lawfully working in
   and visiting the United States. They already had rights or claims to
   stay in the United States — but that wasn't enough to protect them. For
   these individuals, their fates were decided by immigration enforcement
   officers, not judges.

   American Exile: Rapid Deportations That Bypass the Courtroom explains
   the underbelly of U.S. immigration policy through the stories of many
   people who had rights to be here or would be allowed to stay in the
   United States — if just given a chance. These are some of their
   stories.

   Yadira Felix with her grandmother Candelaria Felix

She was forced to leave behind the only life she knew — but she should have
been allowed to stay.

   Yadira Felix (pictured with her grandmother Candelaria Felix) was born
   in Mexico in 1988 and lived in the United States for 20 years. She has
   cognitive disabilities and graduated San Pasqual High School in
   California through a specialized program, making her eligible
   for deferred action for childhood arrivals (DACA). Yadira was waiting
   at a bus stop in California when Border Patrol agents approached and
   arrested her, drove her to the U.S.-Mexico border, and pushed her
   across to Mexico. Yadira was crying that she didn't want to go, but she
   wasn't even given the chance to call her family before being abandoned
   in Mexico. If Yadira had been given a hearing, she could have applied
   for relief under DACA.

   She was only allowed to return to her family in San Diego after the
   U.S. government settled an ACLU lawsuit on behalf of Yadira and many
   like her who were coerced and tricked into abandoning their rights and
   leaving the United States. This settlement is confined to Southern
   California, so there are others like Yadira who still remain in exile.

   Nydia

She was granted asylum, then deported back to her tormenters.

   Nydia, a transgender woman, was granted asylum in the United States
   after repeated physical and sexual attacks in Mexico. Her protected
   status didn't stop Border Patrol from twice deporting her to Mexico
   without a hearing despite verifiable evidence that she had asylum. Back
   in Mexico, Nydia was repeatedly attacked and raped, and then  kidnapped
   by a gang that trafficked her into the sex trade. She later
   successfully fled back to safety in the United States and applied for
   and was granted lawful permanent residence. "I didn't know the
   immigration agents could have helped me," Nydia said, recalling her
   previous attempts to enter the United States. "They had known all the
   reasons I was trying to come back to the U.S., and even knowing them,
   they sent me back."

   Soledad

She asked border officers for protection. Instead, she was prosecuted.

   Soledad fled two decades of physical and psychological abuse by her
   husband in Mexico after gangs had murdered two of her sons. She joined
   her remaining son in California, but after several years, she returned
   to Mexico to say farewell to the aunt who raised her. But her
   ex-husband found her and tried to murder her. Police told her they
   could do nothing to protect her, so she went back to the United
   States.But instead, border officers referred her for prosecution for
   illegal reentry.

   Soledad spent almost two years in detention, first for the criminal
   sentence and then in immigration detention, repeatedly asking for help
   before she was able to speak to an asylum officer. She won release on
   bond and her immigration case is ongoing.

A mother tricked into leaving her home.

   Isidora Lopez-Venegas is the mother of an autistic U.S. citizen son.
   She was arrested by Border Patrol and told — wrongly —that she could
   easily obtain legal status through her son once she was in Mexico. In
   fact, once outside the United States, she would have to wait
   approximately 10 years before returning home to California. But if she
   had seen an immigration judge, she could have presented her strong
   claims to stay. Instead Isidora, accompanied by her son, had to leave
   the United States. They were only able to return home after the ACLU
   filed a lawsuit.
