Story highlights

   The last major convoy of MEK members arrives at a temporary site near
   Baghdad

   The U.N. is overseeing the process to find new homes for them in third
   countries

   MEK is on the U.S. terrorism list because of the killing of 6 Americans
   in the 1970s

   Saddam Hussein invited them to Iraq in an effort to undermine Iran's
   government in 1986
   CNN  —

   The relocation of an Iranian exile group from a refugee camp in Iraq
   where they’ve lived for more than 25 years is nearing completion, the
   United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq said Sunday.

   The last major convoy of 680 members of the Mujahedin-e Khalq, or MEK,
   arrived at the new temporary site, a former U.S. military base near
   Baghdad International Airport, on Sunday, the United Nations Assistance
   Mission for Iraq said.

   “This is an important step as we near the end of the relocation
   process,” said Martin Kobler, special representative for Iraq of the
   U.N. secretary-general.

   The U.N. is overseeing the process to find new homes for the 3,280 MEK
   members in third countries under an agreement reached with the Iraqi
   government last year.

   “I urge the international community to speed up its efforts to accept
   residents in third countries,” Kobler said.

   MEK was placed on the U.S. terrorism list in1997 because of the killing
   of six Americans in Iran in the 1970s and an attempted attack against
   the Iranian mission to the United Nations in 1992. However, since 2004,
   the United States has considered the residents of Camp Ashraf
   “noncombatants” and “protected persons” under the Geneva Conventions.

   Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is under a court order to decide by
   October 1 whether to remove MEK from the terror list. The secretary has
   said several times that her decision would be guided, in part, by
   whether the group moves peacefully from Camp Ashraf.

   MEK leaders have been reluctant to complete the move from Camp Ashraf
   to Camp Hurriya, formerly an American facility known as Camp Liberty.
   They complained about conditions at the new camp, calling it more a
   prison than a home, after the first convoy arrived in February.

   Camp Ashraf was established in 1986 after former Iraqi leader Saddam
   Hussein invited members of MEK to relocate to Iraq in an effort to
   undermine the Iranian government, which was then at war with Iraq. Iran
   also considers the group to be a terrorist organization.

   A U.N. commission on refugees has described the residents as “formal
   asylum seekers” from persecution by the regime in Iran.

   The arrival of the last convoy “marks a significant milestone in
   efforts to achieve a sustainable humanitarian solution to this issue,”
   the U.S. State Department said Sunday.

   A small group remains at the old camp to “residual issues and then also
   move to Camp Hurriya,” the State Department said.
