   After several years of painful, bewildering, infuriating exile, climate
   policy is back on the agenda. Thank god.

   Something pretty remarkable has happened in the last month, and I don’t
   think many people have noticed. After several years in which climate
   policy was sidelined from beltway political discussion, after a
   presidential campaign in which the issue was almost entirely ignored,
   it’s clawing its way back into the conversation. You can feel the
   terrain shifting beneath our feet subtly but unmistakably.

   First there was Sandy, a devastating, 100-year storm that hit the
   nation’s media capital, highlighted just how much damage higher sea
   levels can do, and caused an estimated $50 billion in damages. The
   elephant in the room–the fact that storm intensity will likely grow in
   the future, and combine with higher sea levels to do even more
   damage–did not go unnoticed by politicians.

   Then came news that 2012 was the warmest year in the United States ever
   recorded, and not by a little bit. By a full degree Fahrenheit. And
   then, suddenly, after saying hardly a word about the climate for much
   of the last year, the president himself, to his great credit, has
   pushed it back onto the agenda. In his inaugural address he surprised
   observers by saying this early in the speech, as the first domestic
   policy issue he mentioned after dealing with the economy:

     “We will respond to the threat of climate change, knowing that the
     failure to do so would betray our children and future generations.
     Some may still deny the overwhelming judgment of science, but none
     can avoid the devastating impact of raging fires, and crippling
     drought, and more powerful storms.”

   During Tuesday night’s State of the Union speech, the president once
   again foregrounded climate, putting it as the first domestic policy
   issue after the economy and was even more emphatic in his promises to
   act, saying, ”I urge this Congress to pursue a bipartisan, market-based
   solution to climate change, like the one John McCain and Joe Lieberman
   worked on together a few years ago. But if Congress won’t act soon to
   protect future generations, I will.”

   Then on Thursday, the independent congressional watchdog the Government
   Accountability Office came out with a new report identifying risks to
   the government and at the top of the list was the the fiscal exposure
   the federal government faces due to Climate Change. Remarkably, Darrell
   Issa, the Republican Chairman of the House Oversight and Government
   Reform Committee–he of the Fast and Furious scandalmongering, bete noir
   of liberals–had this to say about the GAO report:

     “I don’t want to walk away from anything in this report…when you
     look climate change and Hurricane Sandy, and others, it points out
     that we have under-prepared through FEMA, and through our emergency
     funds including flood control for a generation.”

   Finally this week, Sens. Bernie Sanders and Barbara Boxer introduced a
   new, ambitious climate bill that, in the admittedly unlikely event it
   is passed, would represent a major victory for climate activists with
   its $20 tax on each ton of carbon pollution as well as its enabling the
   Environmental Protection Agency to regulate fracking.

   After several years of painful, bewildering, infuriating exile, climate
   policy is back on the agenda. Thank god.

   Now, I don’t want to minimize just how far things still have to go and
   how many challenges there are to overcome to make the kinds of changes
   required to reduce the risk of total disaster. We were reminded once
   again this week of the lengths the wealthiest industry in the country,
   the fossil fuel companies who have trillions of dollars on the line,
   will go to preserve their right to dump their pollution cost free.

   This week the Guardian newspaper reported the conservative dark money
   group Donors Trust funneled almost $120 million between 2002 to 2010 to
   groups denying the science on climate change. And that’s on top of the
   sizable funding from Koch Industries, Exxon and others towards
   denialist groups. That funding and the pro-pollution lobbying
   infrastructure aren’t going anywhere.

   There’s also the president himself who, while admirably talking about
   the issue, has yet to indicate whether or not he will use his authority
   to block the wildly destructive Keystone Pipeline, and who after his
   strong words in the State of Union, didn’t indicate in his follow-up
   Google Plus Fireside Hangout that the administration would break any
   new ground in executive action:

     “The same steps that we took with respect to energy efficiency on
     cars, we can take on buildings, we can take on appliances, we can
     make sure that new power plants that are being built are more
     efficient than old ones, and we can continue to put research and our
     support behind clean energy that is going to continue to help us
     transition away from dirtier fuels.”

   And then, perhaps most pernicious at this moment, is the strange
   culture of Washington that views climate as a niche, special interest
   issue relevant only to environmental groups and not every living human
   on the planet. While pundits, strategists, columnists
   and politicians absolutely obsess over budget projections for the year
   2040, those same strategists, columnists and politicians seem
   remarkably sanguine about the fact that Arctic ice volume has shrunk by
   more than a third in the last decade and more and more recent data that
   indicate our previous climate models have underestimated the terrifying
   rate of change to our climate and overestimated just how much time we
   have left to get our collective asses in gear.

   No one will care in 30 years what the deficit was in 2013. I guarantee
   you. Quick pop quiz: what was the deficit in 1953? or 1923? or, heck
   1883? The right answer is: you don’t know because it doesn’t
   matter. What does matter are the molecules in the air, much much more
   than numbers on a balance sheet.

   And I’m sorry to say the strange apathy about the climate extends past
   the usual suspects of deficit-obsessives to people that broadly
   constitute the president’s base. It’s a standard liberal trope of
   activists to whine that fellow liberals aren’t paying enough attention
   to the issue they care most about, but at the risk of falling into it,
   I can’t help but notice that even when the president tries to insert
   climate into the conversation it tends to fall with a dull thud among
   the bulk of progressive politicians, activists, and media outlets.

   Washington will never make climate a priority until the left makes it a
   priority.
