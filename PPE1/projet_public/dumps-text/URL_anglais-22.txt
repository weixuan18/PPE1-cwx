   CNN’s Human to Hero series celebrates inspiration and achievement in
   sport. Click here for videos and features

Story highlights

   Hidetoshi Nakata became Japan's first footballing hero, starring at the
   1998 World Cup

   He is known as "Japan's David Beckham" for his celebrity status on and
   off the field

   In 2006, he made shock decision to retire after his third World Cup,
   aged 29

   He set off traveling the world ... and has now returned to learn about
   Japan
   CNN  —

   By the age of just 29, Hidetoshi Nakata was recognized by many as the
   greatest footballer Japan had ever produced. So why the glum look?

   “To be honest with you, it was not my dream,” Nakata admits, now, to
   CNN’s Human to Hero series, as he reflects on the emotions he was
   feeling at his third World Cup, in Germany in 2006.

   The fans, the media, his teammates: no-one managed to get behind the
   dark designer sunglasses.

   No-one understood why – at the end of a hard-fought defeat to reigning
   champions Brazil, which meant early elimination for Japan – the usually
   stoic Nakata lay down on the turf at the Dortmund’s Westfalenstadion
   and wouldn’t get up.

   “It’s unforgettable,” he says now – but still offers no more
   explanation.

   Meet 'David Beckham of Asia'

   That night, his face cracked with pain, Nakata wept under the
   spotlights.

   Little-known to any of the traveling Japanese fans assembled in the
   terraces that evening, Nakata – a player just reaching the height of
   his powers – had made a secret decision, six months before, to walk
   away from it all.

   Today

   When Nakata arrives to talk about World Cups and what he has been doing
   for the last eight years, he’s nattily dressed – leather jacket, smart
   slacks, brightly-colored socks – and even when out on the pitch, he
   juggles the ball on expensive-looking designer leather pumps.

   It’s not for nothing that he gets described as Asia’s answer to David
   Beckham.

   Like Beckham, the hairstyles are now more restrained – the
   attention-demanding red spikes are long gone – and like the English
   superstar, his reputation continues to extend far beyond his home
   country: both as Japan’s most gifted footballing export and an
   ambassador for Tokyo’s fashion industry.

   It took eight years in the wilderness – first wandering across the
   globe on a meandering journey of self-discovery that he estimates
   covered close to a hundred countries from Tanzania to Turkmenistan –
   but Nakata seems to have found himself.

   “All my life, I played just football. I didn’t know what the world was
   like outside of football,” he explains.

   “I wanted to know what’s happening now in the world, and what I could
   do for the world.”

   In his time away, Nakata – now 37 – appears to have resolved some of
   the contradictions that once made him the misunderstood man of Asia’s
   rising footballing generation.

   Like, why did the flamboyantly dressed star – followed wherever he went
   by battalions of newly galvanized Japanese soccer fans and screeching
   admirers, a man who led the first generation of sports stars to share
   their lives on the internet – plead so strongly for privacy?

   And why did a player whose evident love of the game changed perceptions
   of football in Asia give it all up?

   Having crossed the world looking for answers, he’s finding them closer
   to home. The one-time Calvin Klein underwear model who, for years,
   fought to escape his native country’s media, has returned home with the
   aim to visit each of Japan’s 47 prefectures, hoping to reconnect with
   the “real” people he is getting to know.

   “So many people, so many friends asked me about Japan but I couldn’t
   answer,” he says.

   “In the end, I just realized I didn’t know about Japan.”

   Today, fashion takes a back seat – although he still boasts an
   unmistakable, if now lower-key style – and the focus is on the
   traditional craft of his new job as a sake maker and self-appointed
   ambassador for Japanese culture abroad.

   “I have decided to travel in Japan to learn Japanese culture. So, last
   five years, I have been traveling all the prefectures in Japan, meeting
   craftsmen, farmers, sake makers and trying to see what are the best
   hotels and restaurants … you know, just to tell my friends.”

   Nakata the player

   Nakata arrived on the world stage at France ’98 – a willowy, nimble
   21-year-old with a peroxide orange crop of hair.

   He brought with him the Asian Footballer of the Year title (which he
   would win again the following year) and a defined reputation as a
   prickly interviewee off the field.

   His performances for Japanese J-League club Bellmare, and five goals
   for the national team in qualification for Japan’s historic first World
   Cup, had demonstrated a strong dribbling game and knack for ghosting
   into the penalty area to score goals.

   “The first match was against Argentina, which was very difficult – but
   at the same time I didn’t have anything to lose,” he recalls.

   Flying at full-tilt, making mazing runs through nano-scale gaps in the
   Argentine defense in the second half, Nakata looked like the rare sort
   of player who could make the difference even against the world’s best
   opposition.

   How pioneer Oliseh changed African football

   He’s a player who “never really had problems playing under pressure,”
   he admits.

   “I had a lot of motivation and, just like a small kid, it’s just having
   great toys to play with.”

   Journey to Italy

   Despite losing 1-0 in that match (and succumbing to one-goal losses in
   both the other group games) the debutants became favorites among
   neutrals for their classy, ball-down, passing play and desire to take
   games to vastly more experienced opponents – typified by Nakata.

   The next season would see him whisked off to newly-promoted Serie A
   hopefuls Perugia for $4 million amid reported bids from Manchester
   United, as he became just the second Japanese footballer to play in
   Italy’s top division.

   Critics screamed that the Umbrian club had bought a novelty act – a
   flash in the pan, buoyed by World Cup excitement. Nakata responded with
   silence off the field and by blowing away expectations on it – starting
   with two goals in a 4-3 loss to champions Juventus on the opening day
   of the season.

   “Going to Italy from Japan, obviously, culturally they are totally
   different, so it was very difficult to learn the Italian language and
   the lifestyle as well,” Nakata says.

   “But football is always the same – football is football all over the
   world – so I was just concentrating to play football.”

   He scored 10 times in his first season and soon earned a $29.5 million
   transfer to Fabio Copello’s title-challenging Roma side.

   In the final stretch of the 2000-01 season, he helped Roma come from
   2-0 down against a Zinedine Zidane-inspired Juve, scoring a spectacular
   strike before another long-range attempt led to the equalizer.

   The result proved crucial as Roma secured just its third league title
   since forming in 1927, and it earned Nakata another big-money move to
   Parma – where he won the Italian Cup the following season, scoring a
   crucial late away goal in the first leg of the final against Juventus.

   The joy of football

   His next two World Cup finals would take him from that highest high to
   the lowest low.

   Ex-Soviet footballer's trailblazing career

   In 2002, Japan and South Korea co-hosted as the tournament came to Asia
   for the first time.

   “It was very special because all the population in Japan was really
   expecting something,” Nakata says.

   “So we had to pass through (the group stages) for sure, even though we
   lost all three games in the 1998 World Cup.”

   After a draw against Belgium and a 1-0 win over Russia, Japan faced
   Tunisia in the final group game with all four teams still able to
   qualify. Heading into the last 15 minutes, the host nation had
   struggled to break through, but led 1-0 thanks to a reflex strike from
   substitute midfielder Hiroake Morishima.

   When fellow replacement Daisuke Ichikawa broke down the right and
   floated a high ball toward the back post, Nakata, with a sharp header,
   sent Japan through at the top of the group.

   “When we came out from the stadium, there were so many people outside
   the stadium clapping their hands and it seemed like all of Japan were
   there. And we were so proud of ourselves.”

   Love lost

   The years leading to the next World Cup would be characterized by
   full-blown “Nakatamania” – perhaps apt for a man who was inspired to
   play the game as a child by the popular Japanese cartoon character
   “Captain Tsubasa.”

   Wherever he traveled in Italy, a corps of 20-or-so Japanese reporters
   followed – sending back bulletins on his health, his hairstyle, and any
   hint of a scoop about his private life.

   The onlookers would have to be dragged away from training sessions and
   even friendlies against amateur sides would be beamed across the world
   to be shown live in Japan. Books about him sold in the hundreds of
   thousands.

   Nakata had long since stopped talking to the press – whose tabloid
   intrusions and tired questions had riled him as a young player in
   Japan. Instead he talked through his website Nakata.net, which was
   swamped with 15 million hits a day.

   All this attention was not missed by clubs.

   The reports of offers from Manchester United in 1998 had set off the
   uneasy relationship between Nakata the midfield maestro and – in the
   words of the New York Times’ Paddy Agnew – the “one-man tourist
   attraction and a small merchandising gold mine” he represented to
   owners.

   The rumors that year claimed the bids were backed by United shareholder
   Rupert Murdoch’s BSkyB satellite TV company with an eye to opening up
   deals in east Asia – without team boss Alex Ferguson’s knowledge.

   For years to follow, any club where Nakata pulled on the jersey could
   watch tens of thousands of replicas fly out the shop – mostly to
   Japanese tourists. Wherever he went, fans and press asked whether
   talent or commercial interests justified his presence.

   Why he walked

   After two and a half seasons at Parma, he went to Bologna and
   Fiorentina before finally ending up in England in August 2005.

   However, it was not in Manchester, or London – Nakata signed for
   distinctly unfashionable Premier League club Bolton Wanderers on a loan
   deal.

   The northern town – not far from Manchester, but better known as the
   birthplace of the ice cream wafer sandwich than for its fashion and
   culture credentials – represented even more of a culture shock to
   Nakata.

   “It was difficult to adapt to,” he would later explain in an interview
   with men’s style magazine GQ.

   Under manager Sam Allardyce, Nakata was pinned uncomfortably into a
   rigid 4-4-2 system and rarely allowed to wander freely, as he did at
   his best. After six months, his love for the game faded, and he made
   his secret pact to retire.

   Japan again

   Despite that early end to his top-level career, Nakata has always
   traveled with a pair of boots in his suitcase.

   He’ll be at the next World Cup – backed by his sake brand, to show off
   the Japanese culinary craft and alcohol making he’s learned about on
   his travels – and he’ll often be found playing in charity matches with
   old footballing friends from Italy and Japan.

   I think football is the best tool to communicate with other people, to
   connect the people.

   Hidetoshi Nakata

   Now he sees the game as a way to get to know people – and, perhaps, for
   people to finally get to know him.

   “I think football is huge. I think football is the best tool to
   communicate with other people, to connect the people,” he says.

   “It’s beyond the countries, it’s beyond languages.

   “Football is the biggest thing to share, to connect the entire world so
   … even outside the stadium, I can play football to connect the people.”
