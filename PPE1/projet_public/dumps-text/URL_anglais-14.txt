Story highlights

   He was known as the "Jon Stewart of Egypt"

   Now Bassem Youssef is trying to make it in America
   Los Angeles CNN  —

   You may have heard of Bassem Youssef, the Egyptian satirist often
   pegged as the “Jon Stewart of Egypt,” who fled his home county after
   three years of mocking his nation’s ruling elite over the nation’s
   television airways.

   Now, he wants to make Americans laugh.

   Youssef, who recently settled in California with his family, has just
   published a book, “Revolution for Dummies: Laughing through the Arab
   Spring,” and his story is the subject of a new, captivating documentary
   called “Tickling Giants.”

   Youssef’s trajectory to Egyptian stardom happened phenomenally quickly.
   He was working as surgeon in Cairo when Egypt underwent a revolution in
   2011. Inspired, he started making videos on YouTube from his laundry
   room that lampooned the nation’s state-run media and ruling elite, a
   moonlight exercise that eventually got him his own show on an Egyptian
   television station. In less than a year, the show, which borrowed
   heavily from the style of “The Daily Show” in the US, grew widely
   popular nationwide. (Jon Stewart himself would later pay a visit on the
   program.)

   In a culture not known for widespread religious or government satire,
   Youssef’s show pulled few punches. When the Muslim Brotherhood rose to
   power in the aftermath of the revolution, Youssef gleefully mocked
   then-President Mohammed Morsi on air, words that resulted in a summons
   to appear in court to face charges of insulting the state. The charges
   were later dropped.

   “We come from an area where societies are not allowed to question, not
   allowed to speak against authority,” he said. “We broke that taboo. We
   actually spoke up. We spoke up against presidents, against leaders,
   against institutions that were absolutely untouchable.”

   When the Egyptian military overthrew Morsi in a 2013 coup, Youssef and
   his staff pressed on. By then his show was watched by millions, but the
   attention also drew him criticism from Egyptians — including some in
   his own family — for poking fun at the leaders of the military. His
   broadcasts were frequently jammed and threatened with lawsuits. After
   General Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, who led the coup, became president in
   2014, Youssef terminated the show under intense pressure from the
   government.

   Then, true disaster struck. On Nov. 11, 2014, an Egyptian court ruled
   that Youssef would be forced to pay more than $10 million as penalty
   over the content of his programming. Fearing for the safety of his
   family, Youssef fled his homeland. In just 90 minutes, he packed two
   bags and friends drove him to the airport for a flight to Dubai.

   “When I was driving through the airport, I was thinking, just a couple
   of years ago I was the biggest name in this country, and now I have to
   escape,” he said. “At least we did something, and now I had to run for
   my life.”

   He had many work prospects in the Middle East beyond Egypt, but nothing
   that would allow him to speak freely or make jokes about governments.
   Unsatisfied with his choices in the Arab world, he moved his wife and
   daughter with him to the United States.

   After living in New England and the Bay Area for a time, he and his
   family settled in Los Angeles, where they currently live.

   While Youssef is a known celebrity across the world, in many ways, his
   future in the United States is unclear.

   “I decided to come here to America, start from scratch, from zero –
   where I’m starting from a different people, different language. I am
   starting for a third time, a third career,” he said. “I have the
   concerns that many Americans have. Will I be able to make it or not?”

   For now, his schedule is full with speaking engagements, book talks and
   travel to promote the documentary.

   But he knows that book tours don’t last forever, and he’s searching for
   the role to play permanently in his newly adopted home. His life in Los
   Angeles is spent like many other aspiring hopefuls in the city’s
   viciously competitive entertainment industry: Youssef regularly takes
   acting class and he’s joined an improv group. He does voice-over work
   on the side. He auditions for performance opportunities, roles in
   television, and, like everyone else in the business, rejection is the
   rule, not the exception.

   Of course, he landed in the United States during its own time of some
   political uncertainty. Donald Trump’s rise to the presidency in 2016
   shocked even the best of the political pundit class, a phenomenon
   Youssef has observed closely. He has also watched the reaction to
   Trump, and, from his own experience, knows the limits of satire in
   public life.

   “It’s amazing to see all of this activism. I would love to see 10 times
   more of snarking and making fun. But what does it lead to? I’m just
   worried that people are just resolving to sharing and retweeting and
   reposting stuff, but the fight is every two years, is in your
   mid-terms, in your elections. If you do the digital activism, but don’t
   do that, it’s horrible. You’re just going to laugh yourself to
   destruction,” he said. “Satire is great, but it doesn’t do anything by
   itself.”

   Despite all that he has been through over the past few years, Youseff
   says he doesn’t feel like an exile in the United States, a place he
   plans to make his permanent home.

   “I considered myself an exile even when I was in Egypt. You can be in
   your own country and be an exile if you can’t connect with your own
   people around you,” he said. “You can make your exile home. If you find
   a certain success there, if you find your path, your voice, that makes
   it home.”
