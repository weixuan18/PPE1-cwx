   As international donors examine their priorities in light of Burma’s
   new regime, exile-run news media face potential cutbacks. The most
   critical news reporting on the long-closed nation may be endangered. By

   CHIANG MAI, Thailand
   “In medias res,” the Latin phrase meaning “in the middle of the
   action,” is usually used in a literary context, but sometimes I feel it
   describes the experience of a journalist in exile. It has been 18 years
   since I founded The Irrawaddy, a news publication (and now multifaceted
   news service) based in Chiang Mai. That’s a long time, but the end of
   our journey—our eventual return to a democratic Burma—is still nowhere
   in sight.

   Since we don’t know how far we are from reaching our goal—which is not
   really the end, but actually just the beginning of our real work of
   restoring press freedom in Burma—we feel stuck somewhere in the middle.
   And so we throw ourselves into the day-to-day routine of running a
   media organization, all the while wondering when we will be able to
   practice our trade on our own home soil.

   In some ways, being a journalist in exile means being not in the middle
   of the action, but far from it. These days, however, it is possible to
   keep your ear close to the ground in one country while keeping your
   feet firmly planted in another. Through our network of sources and
   undercover reporters inside Burma, and greatly aided by the latest
   technology, we manage to dig a little more dirt every day—like
   prisoners tunneling our way to a truth the authorities want to prevent
   us from reaching.

   It’s laborious work, but the reward is in knowing that every inch we
   move forward makes a difference. Sometimes, though, it’s difficult to
   know how much of a difference we make. That’s why I often wonder what
   measure of success we can apply to our work.

   By the conventional standards of a modern media organization, we’re not
   doing too badly. We can point to our growing range of products—from our
   original magazine (now a quarterly e-magazine with a limited print run)
   to our well-trafficked Burmese- and English-language websites, from our
   blog and podcast to our television and radio programs broadcast by the
   Democratic Voice of Burma and Radio Free Asia—as evidence of our
   continued relevance.

   We can also look at the numbers: Our websites attract visitors from
   around the world and increasingly from cyber-savvy viewers inside
   Burma, where proxy servers bypass government efforts to block
   “undesirable” content. Between them, our Burmese and English websites
   receive eight or nine million visits annually, with our Burmese site
   showing especially strong growth.

   The feedback we receive every day from our readers suggests that we are
   satisfying a demand. Our weekly television show broadcast via DVB has
   won wide recognition. These days, most people I meet from inside Burma
   tell me they’ve seen and appreciate our program.

   It would be nice to say that we’ve helped in some way to improve the
   media environment inside Burma. But our only contribution in that
   regard has been to provide an outlet for colleagues working within the
   country’s draconian censorship system who want to share stories that
   they can’t report in the domestic press. Otherwise, the situation of
   journalists in Burma remains as grim as ever, even under the current
   “civilian” regime.

   Much has been made of the supposed “opening” of the Burmese media since
   last year’s election. The fact that pictures of pro-democracy leader
   Aung San Suu Kyi, who was released from more than seven years of house
   arrest a week after the November 7 polls, were allowed to appear in
   print has been seen by some as a sign of positive change. But I have my
   doubts.

   There are other issues that remain very much taboo to Burma’s rulers.
   In the country’s border regions, human rights violations remain rife in
   conflict zones. No local publication would dare hint of the rape,
   murder, and forced relocation that are part of the army’s campaign to
   impose its will on ethnic minorities. The brutal suppression of hunger
   strikes by political prisoners is another subject that will never
   appear in the Burmese press. Forced labor, child soldiers in the
   Burmese army, and massive deforestation by cronies of the ruling
   generals are also among the many unmentionables.

   Even the impact of mega-projects that will transform Burma’s landscape
   forever, affecting potentially millions of its citizens, cannot be
   discussed within the pages of the country’s newspapers. Dams in the
   Kachin, Shan, and Karen states are being built to produce energy for
   Burma’s neighbors, while its citizens continue to live with brownouts.
   In Arakan state, a gas pipeline for China will enrich the generals but
   do nothing for local people.

   There has been much speculation that Thein Sein, the ex-general and
   former prime minister who now ostensibly leads the country as its
   president, will start holding regular press conferences. So far,
   however, he remains as remote from the independent press as his
   predecessors, who were never very interested in answering questions
   from anybody.

   This lack of real progress inside Burma—on the issue of media freedom,
   or on any other front—hasn’t prevented some from declaring this a
   turning point in the country’s transition to democracy. This has put
   new pressure on the exile media: As some governments move toward more
   active engagement with Naypyidaw, donors that have long supported our
   work also seem inclined to shift their attention toward the
   possibilities, however illusory, of effecting change from within the
   country.

   Does this mean we are losing our allies, the foundations and government
   agencies that share our commitment to press freedom in Burma? Probably
   not, but our dependence on their support has never seemed more
   precarious. And in some cases—in which former supporters have attacked
   us for our activities, presumably to curry favor with a regime they see
   as a viable “partner”—we have been forced to ask ourselves who our real
   friends are.

   Meanwhile, we have no doubt who the enemy is—anyone who stands in the
   way of telling the stories that need to be told. Even when we are being
   attacked by hackers and other cyber-phantoms, as we recently were, we
   keep our eyes on what is really happening in Burma and try not to get
   sidetracked by distractions. If anything, we take these attempts to
   derail our efforts as a sign that we’re on the right track.

   Despite the challenges that face us on a daily basis, and the
   uncertainties that have always hung over us, we know the only way
   forward is to keep working every day. Eventually, Burma will have that
   breakthrough moment when everything changes, for real and forever. And
   when that day comes, we’ll be ready for it.
