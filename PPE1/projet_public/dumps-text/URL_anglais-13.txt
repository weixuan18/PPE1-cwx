   In 1970, two married Black Panthers fled the United States, fearing a
   setup by the police. During their nearly fifty-year exile, they resumed
   a core part of the Black Panther Party’s mission—serving and building a
   community—far from home, in Tanzania. Also, the Washington
   correspondent Jane Mayer reports on the symbiotic relationship between
   Fox News and the White House.
