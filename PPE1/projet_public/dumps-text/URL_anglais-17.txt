Story highlights

   Musharraf must appear in court

   "It's risky, certainly," he says about his planned return

   He plans to have private security as well as government security
   CNN  —

   About a decade ago, Pervez Musharraf was a powerful president, torn
   between complicated ties with the United States and rising Islamic
   militants at home.

   After four and a half years of self-imposed exile, the former Pakistani
   president hopes to reassert his power.

   Musharraf returned to Karachi on Sunday to help his political party
   gain momentum prior to the May general election.

   The retired general, who wrested power in a bloodless coup in 1999 and
   lost it nine years later, acknowledges that happens next is uncertain.

   Zardari: Musharraf 'murdered my mother'

   “It is risky, certainly,” he said.

   “But when I formed this party, the point was to go back and fight the
   elections. Why I’m going back is to do something for the country. The
   cause is much greater than self. Therefore, I’m prepared to take the
   risks for the sake of my country.”

   More security

   He may not find a warm reception. Last year, Musharraf scuttled his
   plans to return after being warned against doing so by the military.

   “There were indications that they didn’t want me to come, and my own
   colleagues told me not to come,” he acknowledged. “Therefore, I changed
   my mind.”

   This time, he said, he will be protected by his own private security
   agents as well as by government security.

   Pakistan’s upper house of parliament passed a nonbinding resolution in
   January 2012 demanding Musharraf be arrested and tried for treason for
   unconstitutional acts during his regime.

   Musharraf’s lawyer obtained pre-arrest bail for him on Friday, which
   means he will not be arrested for at least 15 days, but must appear in
   court.

   But Human Rights Watch said Saturday that the Pakistani government
   should hold Musharraf accountable for human rights abuses once he
   returns.

   “Musharraf should not be allowed to elude the serious legal proceedings
   against him on his return to Pakistan,” said Ali Dayan Hasan, Pakistan
   director at Human Rights Watch.

   “Only by ensuring that Musharraf faces the well-documented outstanding
   charges against him can Pakistan put an end to the military’s impunity
   for abuses.”

   Under Musharraf, the country’s military and its intelligence agencies
   “committed widespread human rights violations, including the enforced
   disappearances of thousands of political opponents, particularly from
   Balochistan province, and tortured hundreds of Pakistani terrorism
   suspects,” Human Rights Watch said.

   Mixed reviews

   His goal, Musharraf said, is to help lift his country from its malaise.

   “My motivation is to go back and correct the situation, bring it back
   to the level where I left it.”

   He left it and went into self-imposed exile, largely in London, after
   the 2008 elections.

   But he never gave up hopes of returning to the political stage.

   In late 2010, he launched the All Pakistan Muslim League party with a
   view to running for office in 2013.

   His years leading the country earned mixed reviews.

   Under his leadership, Pakistan attained respectable economic growth
   rates and established a generally favorable investment climate. Along
   with that came a growing middle class, a more aggressive media, and a
   more assertive judiciary.

   “He brought parliamentary reforms; he brought women into the
   parliament,” said Ahmed Bilal Mehboob, director of the Pakistan
   Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency in an interview
   last year.

   Military mindset

   But, analysts say, Musharraf never lost his military mindset.

   “He in a way, always believed in a unity of command, a very centralized
   command, which means his command, in fact,” said Lt. Gen. Talat Masood,
   a political analyst.

   Musharraf’s popularity began dropping in 2007 after he suspended
   Supreme Court Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry for “misuse of
   authority.”

   The move triggered protests and accusations that he was trying to
   influence the court’s ruling on whether he could run for another
   five-year term. Chaudhry was reinstated but the damage was done.

   That October, Musharraf was re-elected president by a parliament that
   critics said was stacked with his supporters. Opposition parties filed
   a challenge. The next month, he declared a state of emergency,
   suspended Pakistan’s constitution, replaced the chief judge again and
   blacked out independent TV outlets.

   Under pressure from the West, Musharraf later lifted the emergency and
   promised elections in January 2008.

   He allowed Nawaz Sharif, the prime minister he had deposed in 1999, to
   return from exile.

   He also let in another political foe, former Prime Minister Benazir
   Bhutto, who led the Pakistan Peoples Party.

   Bhutto returned from a self-imposed, eight-year exile to run in the
   country’s general elections in 2007, but was assassinated that December
   while campaigning in the Pakistani city of Rawalpindi, the seat of the
   country’s military, by a 15-year-old suicide bomber.

   Musharraf’s government and the CIA contend the killing was orchestrated
   by a group with ties to al Qaeda, but polls found that most Pakistanis
   believed Musharraf’s government was complicit.

   He has denied the assertions.

   Re-entering politics

   In 2010, further criticism of Musharraf emerged after the United
   Nations ruled that Bhutto’s death could have been prevented had
   Musharraf’s government taken adequate measures to protect her.

   Musharraf rejected the findings, saying that Bhutto had police
   protection and took unnecessary risks.

   Other factors hastened the decline in Musharraf’s popularity: a
   shortage of essential food items, power cuts and high inflation.

   In February 2008, Musharraf’s party admitted defeat in parliamentary
   elections and he was succeeded by Asif Zardari, Bhutto’s widower.

   The leaders of Pakistan’s two main opposition parties formed a
   coalition and vowed to restore deposed judges.

   Six months later, the coalition moved to impeach Musharraf, who then
   resigned as president and went into self-imposed exile, though he said
   the allegations of misconduct were false.

   In August 2009, Pakistan’s supreme court found that Musharraf had
   violated the constitution in 2007 when he imposed a national state of
   emergency. Government officials said that if he returned, he’d be
   arrested.

   In May 2010 Musharraf announced that he planned to re-enter Pakistan
   politics and launched a new political party in October of that year.

   But a Pakistani court then issued an arrest warrant for him in
   connection with Bhutto’s assassination. He has said that the
   accusations are baseless.

   He has described his support as scattered, and said he needs to rebuild
   it.

   “This is a do-or-die moment for me and my party. I need to muster all
   the support I can,” he said.
