   Journalists forced to flee their countries face many challenges,
   including physical attacks and threats to family members they left
   behind. In some cases, they are pushed out of their professions
   completely. In a new feature released ahead of World Refugee Day, CPJ
   examines the risks facing journalists in exile, with recommendations on
   how nations, the UN, and media organizations can assist journalists
   seeking emergency relocation.

   A new report on the 2007 murder of Pakistani journalist Zubair Mujahid,
   from CPJ and other leading press freedom organizations as a part of A
   Safer World for the Truth initiative, finds significant errors in the
   official police investigation. The groups joined in a call for an
   independent re-investigation of the case to bring the killers to
   justice.
