            "articleBody": "Ilya Ponomarev has long been a thorn in the side of Russian president Vladimir Putin.\tFrom leading street protests over his re-election in 2012 to being the only MP to oppose Moscow's annexation of Crimea,\u00a0Ponomarev's position is clear.\tOnly now it's more extreme, a consequence of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\tExiled in Kyiv, the 47-year-old says he is a spokesman for the National Republican Army (NRA), an underground group that wants to violently overthrow the Russian leader.\u00a0\tAmong others, the NRA claims to be behind the car bomb that killed\u00a0Darya Dugina,\u00a0the daughter of .\t\u201cObviously, the end game is regime change in Russia,\u201d Ponomarev told Euronews from the Ukrainian capital Kyiv.\u00a0\u201cYou need to destroy the system so it does not repeat itself. That can be done only violently. There is no other way because the people around Putin will fight.\u201d\tHowever, experts have cast doubt on the existence of the NRA, saying there is little coordination of protests and attacks in Russia.\u00a0\t{{image url=\u201chttps://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/06/96/10/58/{{w}}x{{h}}_cmsv2_b3526e98-3911-5a77-b2aa-6e82bfaf6883-6961058.jpg\u201d align=\u201ccenter\u201d size=\u201cfullwidth\u201d src=\u201chttps://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/06/96/10/58/808\u00d7515_cmsv2_b3526e98-3911-5a77-b2aa-6e82bfaf6883-6961058.jpg\u201d id=\u201c3671758\u201d naturalHeight=\u201c1541\u201d naturalWidth=\u201c2415\u201d caption=\u201cDebris at the site of the car bomb that killed Darya Dugina.\u201d alt=\u201cCredit: AP/Investigative Committee of Russia\u201d credit=\u201cCredit: AP/Investigative Committee of Russia\u201d animation=\u201cfade-in\u201d }}\t\t\t\tNRA \u2018is diverse and decentralised\u2019\t\tRussian-born Ponomarev, once a member of the Communist Party of Russia, served as an MP from 2007 to 2016.\u00a0\tBefore being exiled due to his opposition to Russia's land grab of Crimea, he had worked with\u00a0Dmitry Medvedev, president from 2008-2012.\t\u201cI saw Medvedev as a window of opportunity, and I still think that it was, but when Putin asked him to swap back again, he agreed,\u201d said Ponomarev, referring to Putin returning as president in 2012 after standing aside to avoid term-limit rules.\u00a0\u201cI think that it was possible to reverse Russia's path if Medvedev had stayed, but it didn\u2019t happen and Russia continued on an irrevocable and irreversible path that we are seeing the consequences of now.\u201d\tGranted Ukrainian citizenship in 2019,\u00a0Ponomarev\u00a0says it became clear\u00a0that working within the Russian system cannot change anything.\tAfter the outbreak of war, he launched a news outlet called February Morning, which aims to give a voice to Putin's critics.\u00a0\tNow he helps\u00a0the NRA \u2014 which he says consists of around 500 to 1,000 people and is diverse and decentralised to avoid infiltration \u2014 with advice and assistance.\u00a0\tHe also claims to be helping Ukraine and has connections to other partisan groups operating in Russia.\t\u201cYou know, the people who are criticising me \\[for not criticising Russia's leaders earlier and his links with Medvedev\\], they have done nothing radical, and they are doing nothing,\u201d said\u00a0Ponomarev.\t\u201cThey have done nothing but wish. I have at least done everything possible to change the situation with all the tools that the system gave me.\u201d\t{{image url=\u201chttps://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/07/12/48/48/{{w}}x{{h}}_cmsv2_9ce03f14-cdaf-5a26-8cb0-b59805129c9f-7124848.jpg\u201d align=\u201ccenter\u201d size=\u201cfullwidth\u201d src=\u201chttps://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/07/12/48/48/808\u00d7454_cmsv2_9ce03f14-cdaf-5a26-8cb0-b59805129c9f-7124848.jpg\u201d id=\u201c3733956\u201d naturalHeight=\u201c900\u201d naturalWidth=\u201c1600\u201d caption=\u201cIn this Oct. 22, 2012 file photo, Russian police escort Ilya Ponomarev as they try to clear Bolotnaya Square of opposition protesters.\u201d alt=\u201cCredit: AP\u201d credit=\u201cCredit: AP\u201d animation=\u201cfade-in\u201d }}\t\t\t\tRussian elite \u2018needs to feel like they are in danger\u2019\t\tPonomarev says part of his strategy is to split the Russian elite, arguing Russia's oligarchs are almost only interested in money and being safe. As long as supporting Putin is safer than supporting change, nothing will happen, he adds.\u00a0\tTherefore he wants to make it unsafe for the Russian elite so that they will be ready to switch sides.\t\u0022They do not like what is happening with the war, but they are doing nothing because there is no real danger to their position,\u0022 he said. \u0022That needs to change.\u201d\tThe next step, adds\u00a0Ponomarev, is to make Russians feel they can hit the streets and protest.\u00a0\tAfter any revolution, he believes there is a need for a transition government, tasked with strengthening the rule of law and implementing reforms.\tCorrupt politicians and civil servants in all layers of society will have to be removed and replaced, he adds.\tHe also thinks leaders of any revolution, such as himself, refrain from running in any democratic elections that may follow.\t\u201cAnd I think that the people, like me, who are involved in the transition government should take an obligation, promising not to run after the transition period is over,\u201d says Ponomarev. \u201cI am definitely ready myself to make such an obligation.\u201d\t{{image url=\u201chttps://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/07/12/48/48/{{w}}x{{h}}_cmsv2_f211a535-2ca7-5b6e-81ec-6f247a63419b-7124848.jpg\u201d align=\u201ccenter\u201d size=\u201cfullwidth\u201d src=\u201chttps://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/07/12/48/48/808\u00d7454_cmsv2_f211a535-2ca7-5b6e-81ec-6f247a63419b-7124848.jpg\u201d id=\u201c3733960\u201d naturalHeight=\u201c900\u201d naturalWidth=\u201c1600\u201d caption=\u201cOpposition activist Ilya Ponomarev, center with a loud-hailer speaks to protesters after the massive rally in Pushkin Square, Monday, March 5, 2012.\u201d alt=\u201cCredit: AP\u201d credit=\u201cCredit: AP\u201d animation=\u201cfade-in\u201d }}\t\t\t\tThe NRA could be just \u2018a fantasy\u2019\t\tExperts, however, have cast doubt over whether the NRA is a fantasy.\t\u0022I am not fully convinced that the National Republican Army exist,\u0022 said\u00a0Sergey Radchenko, an expert on Russia from the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.\t\u0022There are protests in Russia and attacks on recruitment offices and infrastructure, but I don't see much organisation to it.\u00a0\t\u0022It makes me think that the National Republican Army is not a reality, but maybe fantasy.\t\u0022There are non-state groups operating around the world, but I don't see any evidence yet that it is the case in Russia.\u00a0\t\u0022Everything is, of course, possible, but I haven't seen any evidence and it makes me suspicious.\t\u0022In absence of evidence, I am sceptical\u2026 I cannot rule out that they exist but it is not just true because Ponomarev says so.\u00a0\t\u0022We have to be cautious and that is the whole point.\u0022",
