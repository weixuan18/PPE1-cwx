A Russian's reflections from exile in Georgia

The Russian journalist says he fled his country because it criminalized
independent war reporting

Russian journalist says he intuitively knew Putin was a 'bloody man'

   Exiled Russia journalist Andrei Loshak describes the state of Russia's
   future, while encouraging Russians to avoid supporting anything in
   favor of the Ukrainian war.

   "At the beginning, the graffiti used to say 'F--- Russia' or 'F---
   Putin,' but now it says 'F--- Russians.' It's unpleasant, of course,"
   Russian journalist Andrei Loshak says.

   He is one of the thousands of Russians who fled to neighboring Georgia
   in the aftermath of the war in Ukraine and around the time that Russia
   criminalized independent war reporting.

   Graffiti aside, Loshak says he is fond of Georgia and relishes that,
   from there, he can say and write what he chooses. He tries to be
   philosophical about all the inconveniences associated with fleeing
   one's country in a heartbeat and having credit cards that are pretty
   much useless anywhere outside of Russia and the reality that he won't
   be able to go home anytime soon.

   The bigger issue, he says, is the incredible malaise about the war and
   what it is doing to his world, his cousins, his neighbors.

   "My soul aches a lot. It aches for Ukraine. It is not a foreign
   country, not an abstract Syria, which is also terrible," Loshak
   says. "War is terrible. But Ukraine is also my native country, my
   native land.  My father was born in Kharkiv, and my grandfather was
   born in Odesa. As a child, I spent every summer in Odesa. All of this
   is sheer pain."

   UKRAINE WARNS MOSCOW IS RUNNING ‘PARALLEL’ EVACUATION ROUTES FROM
   MARIUPOL INTO RUSSIA

   The former Soviet republic of Georgia is famous for its festive tables
   forever groaning with food and local wine, but Loshak says none of his
   compatriot exiles are much in the mood for all that.

   "I haven't watched a single TV series or movie since the war began,
   although I used to watch a lot. And when my Netflix account was shut
   down because I could no longer pay for it, I didn't even notice,"
   Loshak said. "Thousands of people have written to me that they have the
   same condition. You open up Telegram feeds in the morning, and you're
   immersed in this hell, and you can't stop."

   Loshak says one shouldn't hide from this condition, calling it his and
   Russians' "punishment, collective responsibility at least knowing what
   they're doing and what's going on there."

   The pandemic was probably good practice for the independent journalists
   in Russia who now need to do much of their work remotely. It is not
   easy, but many say they are determined to keep at it, countering the
   state propaganda in whatever way they can.

   Loshak is working on a documentary about how many families are fighting
   and splitting and no longer on speaking terms over differing opinions
   of the war. This is causing a big rift in Russian society.  Loshak,
   like many, never believed the war would actually happen.

   Asked when he came to understand just what Russian President Putin was
   capable of, Loshak says it was when explosions in four apartment blocks
   around Russia went off, killing hundreds in the early fall of 1999.

   The Kremlin attributed it to Chechen terrorists. To this day, many
   suspect the hand of the FSB behind those deadly bombings, creating a
   justification for Moscow to invade Chechnya.

   "He never seemed kind to me," Loshak says of Putin. "I actively
   disliked him from 1999, even though I was 26 at the time and wasn't
   interested in politics. But I felt something immediately in my bones
   ... his background, the way he looked, the KGB.

   ZELENSKYY WARNS RUSSIA WILL LIKELY INVADE OTHER COUNTRIES IF SUCCESSFUL
   IN UKRAINE

   "When the terrorist attacks began, on the wave of which he started the
   second Chechen war, intuitively I got the feeling this was a very dirty
   game. And from that moment, I had the feeling he was quite a bloody
   man," Loshak says.

   At some point, he says, that was forgotten and Putin just seemed a
   pragmatic, rational man who would keep Russia in a sort of gray area.

   "But then," Loshak adds, "there was this Dima Yakovlev law."

   The law was drawn up in 2012 in retaliation for the Magnitsky Act being
   passed in Congress.

   The Magnitsky Act called for sanctions on people deemed "human rights
   abusers" in the aftermath of the death of Sergei Magnitsky in a Russian
   jail. It was a death the Russians tried to sweep under the table.

   Dima Yakovlev was a Russian orphan who died at the hands of his
   adoptive U.S. parents after being left in a parked car for nine
   hours. So the Russian retaliatory logic was that no Americans should
   adopt Russian children because they could not be trusted to protect
   them. A rather asymmetrical tit-for-tat, many, including Loshak, say.

   "It was difficult to punish Americans economically, but it was possible
   to do this," Loshak said. "It was total insanity. I don't understand
   how these people are made if they sacrifice children to punish some
   American families."

   Loshak feels Russia has gotten to the point where "it lives in the head
   of an elderly KGB officer with outdated ideas about the world, his
   complexes and so on … the whole country finds itself in this kind of
   insane matrix."

   Asked what Russians seeking change can do now, in the current
   situation, Loshak said, "I don't have an answer right now. I can't say,
   'Guys, come out to rallies' because it makes no sense now. And, anyway,
   I lost this moral authority when I left the country."

   He believes nothing short of hundreds of thousands of people pouring
   onto the streets will force the Russian authorities to stand up and
   listen. But that's not going to happen, according to many observers,
   because people are afraid.

   "There's no point in calling for political activism right now. Perhaps
   we should remember the manifesto (Alexander) Solzhenitsyn wrote in the
   1970s — 'Live Not By Lies,' about how to remain a decent person under
   the conditions of a totalitarian state. You must try not to cooperate
   with it," he says.

   "Do not take money from the state as far as that is possible. Don't owe
   it anything."

   He tells his friends making the hard decision to stay or go to leave.
   "Save your soul," Loshak said, adding Russia "is sliding toward real
   fascism as a form of government."

Zelenskyy and Ukraine's survival – it may be time to consider a government in
exile

Zelenskyy faces a dramatic stay-or-leave decision as the Russian army
converges upon him

   NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles!

   As Russian forces solidify their stranglehold on Kyiv, President
   Volodymyr Zelenskyy must be prepared to stand up a government in exile
   if the capital falls.

   Vlad the Invader seeks to install a puppet regime in Kyiv as soon as
   his tanks and troops occupy the city. At that point, it will be too
   late for Zelenskyy, or any of his senior ministers, to escape death or
   captivity.

   War demands hard choices. And now President Zelenskyy faces a dramatic
   stay-or-leave decision as the Russian army converges upon him.

   UKRAINE'S FIGHTING COSSACK SPIRIT – STALINIST PUTIN WON'T PREVAIL

   Zelenskyy has shown tremendous courage by staying in Kiev since Russia
   invaded Ukraine earlier this month. His decision clearly stiffened the
   will of the Ukrainian military to resist and inspired ordinary citizens
   to take up arms.

   bigger war Video

   But there is something to be said for living to fight another day. The
   decision to relocate is not the same as raising a white flag. Far from
   it. It would represent a prudential choice to continue the fight from a
   more secure foxhole.

   No one faulted Charles de Gaulle when he established a government in
   exile in London during World War II. Nor was he alone. Eight other
   allied governments, to include Norway, Belgium and Poland, set up shop
   in London, helping to mobilize military forces in exile to liberate
   Europe from Nazi tyranny.

   Closer to home, recall that President James Madison left the White
   House for a spell as the British torched Washington, D.C., during the
   War of 1812.

     No one should begrudge Zelenskyy now if he decides to set up camp
     elsewhere.

   No one should begrudge Zelenskyy now if he decides to set up camp
   elsewhere. He has already earned his street cred as a national
   leader. As so-called target number one, he has endured great personal
   risk since day one of the Russian invasion.

   What are the options if he decides to relocate? Zelenskyy could
   relocate to the western part of Ukraine, the only part of the country
   that has remained relatively unscathed from Russian attack so far. But
   this would likely buy his government only a few days before the Russian
   armored columns pivot in hot pursuit.

   There are other alternatives. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has already
   extended an invitation to Zelenskyy. If not London, then perhaps
   someplace closer to Ukraine might do. Warsaw could be an attractive
   option, since Poland borders Zelenskyy’s home country and has already
   accepted a record number of Ukrainian refugees.

   Zelenskyy is his own man. He may well choose to resist until death in
   Kyiv. If so, he will die a hero’s death. Or he may opt to continue the
   resistance from elsewhere.

   "I need ammunition, not a ride," he famously declared a few days
   ago. Well, he has successfully secured ammunition for the resistance,
   with weapons pouring in from the United States, Canada and numerous
   European countries (even Germany has joined!).

   What the Ukraine government needs most right now is to ensure its own
   survival given the increasingly barbaric Russian onslaught. Whether he
   stays in Kyiv or not, Zelenskyy must lay the groundwork for a
   government in exile, to ensure his government survives if Kyiv falls to
   the invader.
   Here's what would happen if Volodymyr Zelenskyy is assassinated Video

   A government in exile will help ensure that Ukraine maintains its
   proper seat in international fora, to include the United Nations.

   The government in exile can also spearhead the international effort to
   support the resistance with Ukraine, as well as a humanitarian
   assistance campaign to deal with the impact of Moscow’s naked
   aggression. Zelenskyy, or his designated successor, will have the
   freedom to rally support around the globe. In contrast, Putin will
   likely remain holed up in Moscow or one his secret lairs, an
   international pariah.

   Setting up a government-in-exile for a country of more than 40 million
   people is no small feat. Beyond providing diplomatic support and
   defensive weaponry to Ukraine, the United States should be prepared to
   assist a government in exile with immediate assistance -- computers,
   secure communications, office equipment and security -- wherever
   Zelenskyy directs his government to set up camp.

   Whatever his decision, President Zelenskyy has already left his mark on
   history with his exemplary courage. By setting up a government in
   exile, he will help to ensure his country’s future.

Edward Snowden and 'How America Lost Its Secrets'

   New book dissects the complex image of Edward Snowden as hero versus
   villain and takes a close look at the vulnerability of US national
   security systems #Tucker

   Controversial whistleblower Edward Snowden, living in exile in Russia,
   said Monday he would like to return to the United States -- but only if
   he can get a fair jury trial.

   “That is the ultimate goal, but if I’m going to spend the rest of my
   life in prison then my one, bottom-line demand that we all have to
   agree to is that at least I get a fair trial,” Snowden said Monday on
   “CBS This Morning."

   Snowden told CBS’ morning show that the U.S. government has “refused”
   to guarantee a fair trial.

   “They won’t provide access to what’s called a public interest defense,”
   Snowden said.

   WASHINGTON POST SAYS IT PASSED ON NEW YORK TIMES’ NOW-REVISED KAVANAUGH
   STORY

   Co-host Tony Dokoupil said criminals don’t typically dictate terms of
   their trial.

   “They broke the law and they face the consequences,” Dokoupil said.
   “What makes you different?”

   ANDREW MCCABE IRKS SOME CNN COLLEAGUES: ‘I HAVE NO SYMPATHIES FOR HIM’

   Snowden fired back: “I’m not different. Again, I’m not asking for a
   parade. I’m not asking for a pardon. I’m not asking for a pass. What
   I’m asking for is a fair trial.”

   Snowden explained to the “CBS This Morning” panel that a jury would
   consider whether his actions were lawful or unlawful, as opposed to
   right or wrong.

   The infamous whistleblower said that he didn’t want to reside in Russia
   but was trapped there when the United States canceled his passport
   while he was traveling to Latin America.

   “I was just trying to continue on my journey into asylum,” he said.

   Gayle King pointed out that the “optics are not good” that he’s in
   Russia, and Snowden agreed.

   “You’re absolutely right and I’m on the same side,” he said. “Of course
   it’s problematic and of course I would like to return to the United
   States.”

   The ex-National Security Agency (NSA) contractor blew the lid off U.S.
   government surveillance methods in 2013. Moscow has resisted U.S.
   pressure to extradite Snowden, who faces charges that could land him in
   prison for up to 30 years.

   The Guardian in Britain published the first story based on Snowden's
   disclosures. It revealed that a secret court order was allowing the
   U.S. government to get Verizon to share the phone records of millions
   of Americans. Later stories, including those in The Washington Post,
   disclosed other snooping and how U.S. and British spy agencies had
   tapped into information from cables carrying the world's phone and
   Internet traffic.

   The Associated Press contributed to this report.

   In 1970, two married Black Panthers fled the United States, fearing a
   setup by the police. During their nearly fifty-year exile, they resumed
   a core part of the Black Panther Party’s mission—serving and building a
   community—far from home, in Tanzania. Also, the Washington
   correspondent Jane Mayer reports on the symbiotic relationship between
   Fox News and the White House.

Story highlights

   He was known as the "Jon Stewart of Egypt"

   Now Bassem Youssef is trying to make it in America
   Los Angeles CNN  —

   You may have heard of Bassem Youssef, the Egyptian satirist often
   pegged as the “Jon Stewart of Egypt,” who fled his home county after
   three years of mocking his nation’s ruling elite over the nation’s
   television airways.

   Now, he wants to make Americans laugh.

   Youssef, who recently settled in California with his family, has just
   published a book, “Revolution for Dummies: Laughing through the Arab
   Spring,” and his story is the subject of a new, captivating documentary
   called “Tickling Giants.”

   Youssef’s trajectory to Egyptian stardom happened phenomenally quickly.
   He was working as surgeon in Cairo when Egypt underwent a revolution in
   2011. Inspired, he started making videos on YouTube from his laundry
   room that lampooned the nation’s state-run media and ruling elite, a
   moonlight exercise that eventually got him his own show on an Egyptian
   television station. In less than a year, the show, which borrowed
   heavily from the style of “The Daily Show” in the US, grew widely
   popular nationwide. (Jon Stewart himself would later pay a visit on the
   program.)

   In a culture not known for widespread religious or government satire,
   Youssef’s show pulled few punches. When the Muslim Brotherhood rose to
   power in the aftermath of the revolution, Youssef gleefully mocked
   then-President Mohammed Morsi on air, words that resulted in a summons
   to appear in court to face charges of insulting the state. The charges
   were later dropped.

   “We come from an area where societies are not allowed to question, not
   allowed to speak against authority,” he said. “We broke that taboo. We
   actually spoke up. We spoke up against presidents, against leaders,
   against institutions that were absolutely untouchable.”

   When the Egyptian military overthrew Morsi in a 2013 coup, Youssef and
   his staff pressed on. By then his show was watched by millions, but the
   attention also drew him criticism from Egyptians — including some in
   his own family — for poking fun at the leaders of the military. His
   broadcasts were frequently jammed and threatened with lawsuits. After
   General Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, who led the coup, became president in
   2014, Youssef terminated the show under intense pressure from the
   government.

   Then, true disaster struck. On Nov. 11, 2014, an Egyptian court ruled
   that Youssef would be forced to pay more than $10 million as penalty
   over the content of his programming. Fearing for the safety of his
   family, Youssef fled his homeland. In just 90 minutes, he packed two
   bags and friends drove him to the airport for a flight to Dubai.

   “When I was driving through the airport, I was thinking, just a couple
   of years ago I was the biggest name in this country, and now I have to
   escape,” he said. “At least we did something, and now I had to run for
   my life.”

   He had many work prospects in the Middle East beyond Egypt, but nothing
   that would allow him to speak freely or make jokes about governments.
   Unsatisfied with his choices in the Arab world, he moved his wife and
   daughter with him to the United States.

   After living in New England and the Bay Area for a time, he and his
   family settled in Los Angeles, where they currently live.

   While Youssef is a known celebrity across the world, in many ways, his
   future in the United States is unclear.

   “I decided to come here to America, start from scratch, from zero –
   where I’m starting from a different people, different language. I am
   starting for a third time, a third career,” he said. “I have the
   concerns that many Americans have. Will I be able to make it or not?”

   For now, his schedule is full with speaking engagements, book talks and
   travel to promote the documentary.

   But he knows that book tours don’t last forever, and he’s searching for
   the role to play permanently in his newly adopted home. His life in Los
   Angeles is spent like many other aspiring hopefuls in the city’s
   viciously competitive entertainment industry: Youssef regularly takes
   acting class and he’s joined an improv group. He does voice-over work
   on the side. He auditions for performance opportunities, roles in
   television, and, like everyone else in the business, rejection is the
   rule, not the exception.

   Of course, he landed in the United States during its own time of some
   political uncertainty. Donald Trump’s rise to the presidency in 2016
   shocked even the best of the political pundit class, a phenomenon
   Youssef has observed closely. He has also watched the reaction to
   Trump, and, from his own experience, knows the limits of satire in
   public life.

   “It’s amazing to see all of this activism. I would love to see 10 times
   more of snarking and making fun. But what does it lead to? I’m just
   worried that people are just resolving to sharing and retweeting and
   reposting stuff, but the fight is every two years, is in your
   mid-terms, in your elections. If you do the digital activism, but don’t
   do that, it’s horrible. You’re just going to laugh yourself to
   destruction,” he said. “Satire is great, but it doesn’t do anything by
   itself.”

   Despite all that he has been through over the past few years, Youseff
   says he doesn’t feel like an exile in the United States, a place he
   plans to make his permanent home.

   “I considered myself an exile even when I was in Egypt. You can be in
   your own country and be an exile if you can’t connect with your own
   people around you,” he said. “You can make your exile home. If you find
   a certain success there, if you find your path, your voice, that makes
   it home.”

Story highlights

   Yemen's President had been in exile for six months

   War has resulted in the death of at least 4,000 civilians, rebels say
   CNN  —

   Yemeni President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi arrived in the southern Yemeni
   city of Aden on Tuesday after six months in exile in Saudi Arabia,
   Yemeni Foreign Minister Riyad Yassin told CNN.

   Last week, Yemeni Prime Minster Khaled Bahah and several Cabinet
   members from the internationally recognized government arrived in Aden
   and announced they were restarting government operations in the
   country.

   Hadi and his government had been in exile in Saudi Arabia since March,
   when Shiite Houthi rebels took over Sanaa, the Yemeni capital.

   Saudi Arabia and its coalition partners launched airstrikes on Houthi
   positions across Yemen in March, hoping to wipe out the Iranian-allied
   rebel group that overthrew the government and seized power.

   The southern city of Aden is under the control of the Saudi-backed
   coalition forces that support Hadi. But fighting between Houthi rebels
   and forces loyal to Hadi continues to rage elsewhere in the country.

   The six-month war has left at least 4,000 civilians dead, according to
   the Houthi-controlled Health Ministry.

Story highlights

   The last major convoy of MEK members arrives at a temporary site near
   Baghdad

   The U.N. is overseeing the process to find new homes for them in third
   countries

   MEK is on the U.S. terrorism list because of the killing of 6 Americans
   in the 1970s

   Saddam Hussein invited them to Iraq in an effort to undermine Iran's
   government in 1986
   CNN  —

   The relocation of an Iranian exile group from a refugee camp in Iraq
   where they’ve lived for more than 25 years is nearing completion, the
   United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq said Sunday.

   The last major convoy of 680 members of the Mujahedin-e Khalq, or MEK,
   arrived at the new temporary site, a former U.S. military base near
   Baghdad International Airport, on Sunday, the United Nations Assistance
   Mission for Iraq said.

   “This is an important step as we near the end of the relocation
   process,” said Martin Kobler, special representative for Iraq of the
   U.N. secretary-general.

   The U.N. is overseeing the process to find new homes for the 3,280 MEK
   members in third countries under an agreement reached with the Iraqi
   government last year.

   “I urge the international community to speed up its efforts to accept
   residents in third countries,” Kobler said.

   MEK was placed on the U.S. terrorism list in1997 because of the killing
   of six Americans in Iran in the 1970s and an attempted attack against
   the Iranian mission to the United Nations in 1992. However, since 2004,
   the United States has considered the residents of Camp Ashraf
   “noncombatants” and “protected persons” under the Geneva Conventions.

   Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is under a court order to decide by
   October 1 whether to remove MEK from the terror list. The secretary has
   said several times that her decision would be guided, in part, by
   whether the group moves peacefully from Camp Ashraf.

   MEK leaders have been reluctant to complete the move from Camp Ashraf
   to Camp Hurriya, formerly an American facility known as Camp Liberty.
   They complained about conditions at the new camp, calling it more a
   prison than a home, after the first convoy arrived in February.

   Camp Ashraf was established in 1986 after former Iraqi leader Saddam
   Hussein invited members of MEK to relocate to Iraq in an effort to
   undermine the Iranian government, which was then at war with Iraq. Iran
   also considers the group to be a terrorist organization.

   A U.N. commission on refugees has described the residents as “formal
   asylum seekers” from persecution by the regime in Iran.

   The arrival of the last convoy “marks a significant milestone in
   efforts to achieve a sustainable humanitarian solution to this issue,”
   the U.S. State Department said Sunday.

   A small group remains at the old camp to “residual issues and then also
   move to Camp Hurriya,” the State Department said.

   Musharraf must appear in court

   "It's risky, certainly," he says about his planned return

   He plans to have private security as well as government security
   CNN  —

   About a decade ago, Pervez Musharraf was a powerful president, torn
   between complicated ties with the United States and rising Islamic
   militants at home.

   After four and a half years of self-imposed exile, the former Pakistani
   president hopes to reassert his power.

   Musharraf returned to Karachi on Sunday to help his political party
   gain momentum prior to the May general election.

   The retired general, who wrested power in a bloodless coup in 1999 and
   lost it nine years later, acknowledges that happens next is uncertain.

   Zardari: Musharraf 'murdered my mother'

   “It is risky, certainly,” he said.

   “But when I formed this party, the point was to go back and fight the
   elections. Why I’m going back is to do something for the country. The
   cause is much greater than self. Therefore, I’m prepared to take the
   risks for the sake of my country.”

   More security

   He may not find a warm reception. Last year, Musharraf scuttled his
   plans to return after being warned against doing so by the military.

   “There were indications that they didn’t want me to come, and my own
   colleagues told me not to come,” he acknowledged. “Therefore, I changed
   my mind.”

   This time, he said, he will be protected by his own private security
   agents as well as by government security.

   Pakistan’s upper house of parliament passed a nonbinding resolution in
   January 2012 demanding Musharraf be arrested and tried for treason for
   unconstitutional acts during his regime.

   Musharraf’s lawyer obtained pre-arrest bail for him on Friday, which
   means he will not be arrested for at least 15 days, but must appear in
   court.

   But Human Rights Watch said Saturday that the Pakistani government
   should hold Musharraf accountable for human rights abuses once he
   returns.

   “Musharraf should not be allowed to elude the serious legal proceedings
   against him on his return to Pakistan,” said Ali Dayan Hasan, Pakistan
   director at Human Rights Watch.

   “Only by ensuring that Musharraf faces the well-documented outstanding
   charges against him can Pakistan put an end to the military’s impunity
   for abuses.”

   Under Musharraf, the country’s military and its intelligence agencies
   “committed widespread human rights violations, including the enforced
   disappearances of thousands of political opponents, particularly from
   Balochistan province, and tortured hundreds of Pakistani terrorism
   suspects,” Human Rights Watch said.

   Mixed reviews

   His goal, Musharraf said, is to help lift his country from its malaise.

   “My motivation is to go back and correct the situation, bring it back
   to the level where I left it.”

   He left it and went into self-imposed exile, largely in London, after
   the 2008 elections.

   But he never gave up hopes of returning to the political stage.

   In late 2010, he launched the All Pakistan Muslim League party with a
   view to running for office in 2013.

   His years leading the country earned mixed reviews.

   Under his leadership, Pakistan attained respectable economic growth
   rates and established a generally favorable investment climate. Along
   with that came a growing middle class, a more aggressive media, and a
   more assertive judiciary.

   “He brought parliamentary reforms; he brought women into the
   parliament,” said Ahmed Bilal Mehboob, director of the Pakistan
   Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency in an interview
   last year.

   Military mindset

   But, analysts say, Musharraf never lost his military mindset.

   “He in a way, always believed in a unity of command, a very centralized
   command, which means his command, in fact,” said Lt. Gen. Talat Masood,
   a political analyst.

   Musharraf’s popularity began dropping in 2007 after he suspended
   Supreme Court Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry for “misuse of
   authority.”

   The move triggered protests and accusations that he was trying to
   influence the court’s ruling on whether he could run for another
   five-year term. Chaudhry was reinstated but the damage was done.

   That October, Musharraf was re-elected president by a parliament that
   critics said was stacked with his supporters. Opposition parties filed
   a challenge. The next month, he declared a state of emergency,
   suspended Pakistan’s constitution, replaced the chief judge again and
   blacked out independent TV outlets.

   Under pressure from the West, Musharraf later lifted the emergency and
   promised elections in January 2008.

   He allowed Nawaz Sharif, the prime minister he had deposed in 1999, to
   return from exile.

   He also let in another political foe, former Prime Minister Benazir
   Bhutto, who led the Pakistan Peoples Party.

   Bhutto returned from a self-imposed, eight-year exile to run in the
   country’s general elections in 2007, but was assassinated that December
   while campaigning in the Pakistani city of Rawalpindi, the seat of the
   country’s military, by a 15-year-old suicide bomber.

   Musharraf’s government and the CIA contend the killing was orchestrated
   by a group with ties to al Qaeda, but polls found that most Pakistanis
   believed Musharraf’s government was complicit.

   He has denied the assertions.

   Re-entering politics

   In 2010, further criticism of Musharraf emerged after the United
   Nations ruled that Bhutto’s death could have been prevented had
   Musharraf’s government taken adequate measures to protect her.

   Musharraf rejected the findings, saying that Bhutto had police
   protection and took unnecessary risks.

   Other factors hastened the decline in Musharraf’s popularity: a
   shortage of essential food items, power cuts and high inflation.

   In February 2008, Musharraf’s party admitted defeat in parliamentary
   elections and he was succeeded by Asif Zardari, Bhutto’s widower.

   The leaders of Pakistan’s two main opposition parties formed a
   coalition and vowed to restore deposed judges.

   Six months later, the coalition moved to impeach Musharraf, who then
   resigned as president and went into self-imposed exile, though he said
   the allegations of misconduct were false.

   In August 2009, Pakistan’s supreme court found that Musharraf had
   violated the constitution in 2007 when he imposed a national state of
   emergency. Government officials said that if he returned, he’d be
   arrested.

   In May 2010 Musharraf announced that he planned to re-enter Pakistan
   politics and launched a new political party in October of that year.

   But a Pakistani court then issued an arrest warrant for him in
   connection with Bhutto’s assassination. He has said that the
   accusations are baseless.

   He has described his support as scattered, and said he needs to rebuild
   it.

   “This is a do-or-die moment for me and my party. I need to muster all
   the support I can,” he said.

Story highlights

   Kurdish photographer Warzer Jaff spends week documenting Yazidi Kurds

   ISIS has hounded Yazidis from their ancient homeland in northern Iraq

   Tens of thousands of families have sought shelter in Iraqi Kurdistan

   Each refugee shares horrifying stories of abduction and murder
   Irbil, Iraqi Kurdistan CNN  —

   They are the faces of an entire community on the run.

   Singled out, threatened, chased at gunpoint from their homes.

   Pursued purely because they are members of an ethnic and religious
   minority.

   Iraq’s Yazidi Kurds are no strangers to persecution. Their faith
   teaches them that throughout history, they have been subjected to 72
   genocides. Many world leaders fear they are on the brink of a 73rd
   massacre, this time at the hands of the Islamic State in Iraq and
   Syria, which calls itself the Islamic State.

   ISIS: We've taken Yazidi women, children

   Kurdish photographer Warzer Jaff spent a week documenting the exodus of
   the Yazidis from their ancient homeland. What is immediately striking
   in his portraits are their piercing eyes.

   “I am fascinated with the deep sadness in their eyes,” Jaff says. “You
   don’t see one single happy face.”

   There is little room for joy when one has been made instantly homeless.

   In the weeks since ISIS militants overran cities and towns in northern
   Iraq, the Yazidis joined a modern-day exodus of hundreds of thousands
   of other Iraqis. Most of those fleeing come from the many other ethnic
   and religious minorities that make up the mosaic of the region,
   including Chaldeans, Assyrians, Turcomen, Shi’ites, Shabbak, Kurds.

   Instantly made homeless, tens of thousands of these families have
   sought shelter in Iraqi Kurdistan. Driving through this region, one can
   see families squatting under bridges, camping in derelict buildings,
   unfinished construction sites, churches, youth centers, open fields.

   Each refugee shares horrifying stories of abduction and murder. Even
   more disturbing, the frequent refrain that “our neighbors did this to
   us.”

   Their claims that Arab tribesmen joined in the looting and kidnapping
   of these defenseless minorities suggests there is little hope these
   communities will one day live side by side together again in peace. As
   one senior Kurdish official put it, “the social fabric has been torn.”

   “I don’t want to live with Arabs anymore, they take our land, they
   kidnap our women, and they kill us, why should I live with them?” asked
   Ali Khalid, 75, a Yazidi.

   He wandered amid the tents of a brand new refugee camp leaning on a
   cane; his long white mustache, a proud symbol for Yazidi men, drooping
   over his mouth. Like nearly every other displaced Iraqi we met over the
   last week, Khalid urged Western governments to grant his people asylum
   in Europe or North America.

   Not far away, a grieving mother showed a laminated identity card. It
   belonged to her 20-year old daughter, Baran. She was fatally wounded by
   shrapnel two weeks ago, Khokhe Namir said, while racing out into the
   backyard to pull a child back to safety.

   “I buried her with my own hands,” Namir said, scraping at the dirt with
   her fingers, as tears streamed down her cheeks.

   Amid the grief and despair, there are still moments of childlike
   innocence. In a refugee camp for Iraqis that sprouted up in a
   Kurdish-controlled enclave in Syria, a red-haired girl picked through a
   pile of second-hand clothes donated by local Kurds.

   “I like the bright colors and the flowers,” she said, after eyeing a
   long dress decorated with pink flowers.

   Last Friday, Jaff wandered up from a tent in a refugee camp in Iraqi
   Kurdistan visibly shaken. “There’s a newborn baby who was born on the
   mountain, I’m afraid she’s going to die,” he said.

   In the tent, the parents of the 6-day-old girl had bound their infant
   in a sheet and laid her on the dirt, atop a pile of blankets and
   cushions. They didn’t have a cradle for the child.

   The girl was born on Sinjar Mountain. Tens of thousands of Yazidis
   sought refuge on its heights as they fled ISIS fighters, only to find
   themselves trapped and surrounded by the militants.

   Jaff took the little girl’s parents into town and bought them a cradle
   and extra food for their baby. Across the Kurdish regions of Iraq and
   Syria, there have been many similar acts of kindness and generosity
   from locals toward their less fortunate cousins from farther south.

   The baby’s parents told me despite the heat, she was eating normally.
   The girl appeared healthy. Her mother said she was thinking of naming
   her child Hajar. Loosely translated, that means migrant or as the
   family interpreted it, “Exile.”

Story highlights

   Fethullah Gulen rarely leaves Pennsylvania home or allows journalists
   in

   Coup attempt in Turkey and protests outside his house lead to rare
   chance for an interview
   CNN  —

   From the road, it’s easy to miss.

   A nondescript driveway with a guard gate off a rural Pennsylvania
   one-lane road.

   Tucked away in the Poconos lies the compound where Fethullah Gulen, a
   moderate Turkish Muslim cleric, has been in self-imposed exile from his
   country since 1999.

   For years, journalists have tried to get in, but very few have
   succeeded.

   This time, reporters have gathered to cover a protest on the road in
   front of the compound after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan
   publicly accused Gulen of organizing a failed coup from nearly halfway
   around the world.

   Gulen rarely emerges, we’re told, and only for medical appointments.

   Protesters gather at exiled Turkish cleric's house

   But as the protests wound down outside the complex, his guards emerged,
   inviting media here to enter for a tour.

   Beyond the gates is a sprawling complex. Several buildings, a garden, a
   pond.

   The grounds are quiet, and few people are here.

   Journalists are shown around and allowed to take pictures, then taken
   to a small building with a table and chairs and air conditioning. We’re
   brought coffee and water, and told that if we wait, we might get to
   talk to Gulen’s press aid, and possibly Gulen himself.

   We’re told he’s in poor health, and needs to rest, but if we wait, he
   may talk about the accusations made against him.

   Textbook case: How to survive a coup

   Erdogan and Gulen are former allies whose relationship fell into a
   bitter feud in 2013. Erdogan supporters outside Gulen’s Pennsylvania
   home called him inflammatory names. Gulen’s supporters accused Erdogan
   of scapegoating Gulen after the failed coup in an attempt to grab more
   power.

   The former president of Gulen’s mosque, Bekir Aksoy, says Gulen, in his
   late 70s, barely ever leaves his room.

   “This was the exception,” he says, because of the seriousness of the
   accusations Erdogan made against him on worldwide television.

   The man blamed for Turkish coup attempt

   “He never goes out of that building, he never goes out of his room,
   really,” Aksoy says. “Except for talking to people for afternoon prayer
   and also for the regular prayer times, that’s all.”

   Then, after about an hour, reporters are led in. We remove our shoes,
   and are escorted in to a room where Gulen sits waiting in a chair.

   Through his interpreter, he answers one question from each reporter.

   He tells us his self-exile was to get away from political opponents who
   were harassing him in Turkey, and that he rejects the idea of being
   involved in a coup, having lived through many military coups in Turkey
   in the ’60s, ‘70s and ‘80s, and having been jailed at least once.

   “My position on democracy is really clear. Any attempt to overthrow the
   country is a betrayal to our unity and is treason,” he says.

     Opinion: The tragedy of the attempted coup

   He denies the accusations against him by Erdogan and says he wishes to
   stay in the United States, in what he calls “the final days of his
   life.”

   “I’m not seriously concerned about the request for extradition as it
   was mentioned this is not a formal request, anyway,” Gulen says.

   As the interview concludes, Gulen says something to his interpreter,
   and we are given access to his living quarters, a quaint space
   decorated with personal belongings from his years in Turkey.

   It consists of little more than a bed and bookshelves.

   The man accused of orchestrating a coup spends his time here. One of
   his aides compares it to a cell.

   On our way out, we’re shown a lit-panorama of Istanbul. His aides say
   Gulen believes this is the closest he’ll ever be to his home again.

   And then we’re given Turkish delight and other sweets. His press aide
   says it’s so we will leave with a good taste in our mouths.

Exile

   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
   Jump to navigation Jump to search
   Event by which a person is forced away from home
   For other uses, see Exile (disambiguation).
   Napoleon's Exile on Saint Helena by Franz Josef Sandman (1820)
   The First Night in Exile – This painting comes from a celebrated series
   illustrating one of Hinduism's great epics, the Ramayana. It tells the
   story of prince Rama, who is wrongly exiled from his father's kingdom,
   accompanied only by his wife and brother.
   Dante in Exile by Domenico Petarlini [es]

   Exile is primarily penal expulsion from one's native country, and
   secondarily expatriation or prolonged absence from one's homeland under
   either the compulsion of circumstance or the rigors of some high
   purpose. Usually persons and peoples suffer exile, but sometimes social
   entities like institutions (e.g. the papacy or a government) are forced
   from their homeland.

   In Roman law, exsilium denoted both voluntary exile and banishment as a
   capital punishment alternative to death. Deportation was forced exile,
   and entailed the lifelong loss of citizenship and property. Relegation
   was a milder form of deportation, which preserved the subject's
   citizenship and property.^[1]

   The term diaspora describes group exile, both voluntary and forced.
   "Government in exile" describes a government of a country that has
   relocated and argues its legitimacy from outside that country.
   Voluntary exile is often depicted as a form of protest by the person
   who claims it, to avoid persecution and prosecution (such as tax or
   criminal allegations), an act of shame or repentance, or isolating
   oneself to be able to devote time to a particular pursuit.

   Article 9 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that "No
   one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile."

For individuals[edit]

For Inanimate Objects[edit]

   Ivan the Terrible once exiled to Siberia an inanimate object -- a
   bell.^[2] "When the inhabitants of the town of Uglich rang their bell
   to rally a demonstration against Ivan the Terrible, the cruel Czar
   executed two hundred (nobles), and exiled the Uglich bell to Siberia,
   where it remained for two hundred years."^[3]

Exiled heads of state[edit]

   Main article: List of heads of state or government who have been in
   exile

   In some cases the deposed head of state is allowed to go into exile
   following a coup or other change of government, allowing a more
   peaceful transition to take place or to escape justice.^[4]

Avoiding tax or legal matters[edit]

   Main articles: Tax exile and Fugitive

   A wealthy citizen who moves to a jurisdiction with lower taxes is
   termed a tax exile. Creative people such as authors and musicians who
   achieve sudden wealth sometimes choose this. Examples include the
   British-Canadian writer Arthur Hailey, who moved to the Bahamas to
   avoid taxes following the runaway success of his novels Hotel and
   Airport,^[5] and the English rock band the Rolling Stones who, in the
   spring of 1971, owed more in taxes than they could pay and left Britain
   before the government could seize their assets. Members of the band all
   moved to France for a period of time where they recorded music for the
   album that came to be called Exile on Main Street, the Main Street of
   the title referring to the French Riviera.^[6] In 2012, Eduardo
   Saverin, one of the founders of Facebook, made headlines by renouncing
   his U.S. citizenship before his company's IPO.^[7] The dual
   Brazilian/U.S. citizen's decision to move to Singapore and renounce his
   citizenship spurred a bill in the U.S. Senate, the Ex-PATRIOT Act,
   which would have forced such wealthy tax exiles to pay a special tax in
   order to re-enter the United States.^[8]

   In some cases a person voluntarily lives in exile to avoid legal
   issues, such as litigation or criminal prosecution. An example of this
   is Asil Nadir, who fled to the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus for
   17 years rather than face prosecution in connection with the failed
   £1.7 bn company Polly Peck in the United Kingdom.

Avoiding violence or persecution, or in the aftermath of war[edit]

   Examples include:
     * Iraqi academics asked to return home "from exile" to help rebuild
       Iraq in 2009^[9]
     * Jews who fled persecution from Nazi Germany^[10]
     * People undertaking a religious or civil liberties role in society
       may be forced into exile due to threat of persecution. For example,
       nuns were exiled following the Communist coup d'état of 1948 in
       Czechoslovakia.^[11]

Euphemism for convict[edit]

   Exile, government man and assigned servant were all euphemisms used in
   the 19th century for convicts under sentence who had been transported
   from Britain to Australia.^[12]

For groups, nations and governments[edit]

Comfortable exile[edit]

   Main articles: Social alienation and Identity (social science)

   Comfortable exile is an alternative theory recently developed by
   anthropologist Binesh Balan in 2018. According to him, comfortable
   exile is a "social exile of people who have been excluded from the
   mainstream society. Such people are considered 'aliens' or internal
   'others' on the grounds of their religious, racial, ethnic, linguistic
   or caste-based identity and therefore they migrate to a comfortable
   space elsewhere after having risked their lives to restore
   representation, identity and civil rights in their own country and
   often capture a comfortable identity to being part of a dominant
   religion, society or culture."^[13]

Nation in exile[edit]

   Main articles: Diaspora and Refugee

   When a large group, or occasionally a whole people or nation is exiled,
   it can be said that this nation is in exile, or "diaspora". Nations
   that have been in exile for substantial periods include the Jews, who
   were deported by Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar II in 586 BC and again
   following the destruction of the second Temple in Jerusalem in AD 70.
   Many Jewish prayers include a yearning to return to Jerusalem and the
   Jewish homeland.^[14]

   After the partitions of Poland in the late 18th century, and following
   the uprisings (like Kościuszko Uprising, November Uprising and January
   Uprising) against the partitioning powers (Russia, Prussia and
   Austria), many Poles have chosen – or been forced – to go into exile,
   forming large diasporas (known as Polonia), especially in France and
   the United States.^[15] The entire population of Crimean Tatars
   (numbering 200,000 in all) that remained in their homeland of Crimea
   was exiled on 18 May 1944 to Central Asia as a form of ethnic cleansing
   and collective punishment on false accusations.^[16]

   Since the Cuban Revolution, over a million Cubans have left Cuba. Most
   of these self-identified as exiles as their motivation for leaving the
   island is political in nature. At the time of the Cuban Revolution,
   Cuba only had a population of 6.5 million, and was not a country that
   had a history of significant emigration, it being the sixth largest
   recipient of immigrants in the world as of 1958. Most of the exiles'

  Government in exile[edit]

   Main article: Government in exile

   During a foreign occupation or after a coup d'état, a government in
   exile of a such afflicted country may be established abroad. One of the
   most well-known instances of this is the Polish government-in-exile, a
   government in exile that commanded Polish armed forces operating
   outside Poland after German occupation during World War II. Other
   examples include the Free French Forces government of Charles de Gaulle
   of the same time, and the Central Tibetan Administration, commonly
   known as the Tibetan government-in-exile, and headed by the 14th Dalai
   Lama.

In popular culture[edit]

  Drama[edit]

   Jason and Medea, by John William Waterhouse, 1907

   Rama on the way

   Exile is an early motif in ancient Greek tragedy. In the ancient Greek
   world, this was seen as a fate worse than death. The motif reaches its
   peak on the play Medea, written by Euripides in the fifth century BC,
   and rooted in the very old oral traditions of Greek mythology.
   Euripides' Medea has remained the most frequently performed Greek
   tragedy through the 20th century.^[18]

   After Medea was abandoned by Jason and had become a murderess out of
   revenge, she fled to Athens and married king Aigeus there, and became
   the stepmother of the hero Theseus. Due to a conflict with him, she
   must leave the Polis and go away into exile. John William Waterhouse
   (1849–1917), the English Pre-Raphaelite painter's famous picture Jason
   and Medea shows a key moment before, when Medea tries to poison
   Theseus.^[19]

  Literature[edit]

   In ancient Rome, the Roman Senate had the power to declare the exile to
   individuals, families or even entire regions. One of the Roman victims
   was the poet Ovid, who lived during the reign of Augustus. He was
   forced to leave Rome and move away to the city of Tomis on the Black
   Sea, now Constanta. There he wrote his famous work Tristia (Sorrows)
   about his bitter feelings in exile.^[20] Another, at least in a
   temporary exile, was Dante.

   The German-language writer Franz Kafka described the exile of Karl
   Rossmann in the posthumously published novel Amerika.^[21]

   During the period of National Socialism in the first few years after
   1933, many Jews, as well as a significant number of German artists and
   intellectuals fled into exile; for instance, the authors Klaus Mann and
   Anna Seghers. So Germany's own exile literature emerged and received
   worldwide credit.^[22] Klaus Mann finished his novel Der Vulkan [de]
   (The Volcano. A Novel Among Emigrants) in 1939^[23] describing the
   German exile scene, "to bring the rich, scattered and murky experience
   of exile into epic form",^[24] as he wrote in his literary balance
   sheet. At the same place and in the same year, Anna Seghers published
   her famous novel Das siebte Kreuz (The Seventh Cross, published in the
   United States in 1942).

   Important exile literatures in recent years include that of the
   Caribbean, many of whose artists emigrated to Europe or the United
   States for political or economic reasons. These writers include Nobel
   Prize winners V. S. Naipaul and Derek Walcott as well as the novelists
   Edwidge Danticat and Sam Selvon.^[25]

60 years after exile, Tibetans face a fight for survival in a post-Dalai Lama

   The history of the Dalai Lama's exile
   03:11 - Source: CNN
   New Delhi CNN  —

   The Dalai Lama describes it as “freedom in exile,” but it’s a “freedom”
   which has lasted longer than he likely ever dreamed about.

   Sixty years ago today, the Tibetan Buddhist leader set foot on Indian
   soil to begin his life as a refugee.

   After an unsuccessful revolt following the arrival of Chinese troops in
   Tibet, the Dalai fled Lhasa in fear for his life. Only 23 years old, he
   and his followers crossed a treacherous Himalayan pass into India on
   horseback, arriving on March 31, 1959.

   Then-Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru offered the religious
   leader asylum along with tens of thousands of other Tibetans who had
   followed him into exile.

   Ever since, the Dalai Lama – who is revered as a living god by millions
   of Tibetan Buddhists – has made India his home. India officially calls
   him “(our) most esteemed and honored guest.”

   “I’m the longest guest of the Indian government,” the Dalai Lama, the
   14th holder of the title, jokingly told CNN in an interview in 2009.

   But as Tibetans mark 60 years of exile for their cultural icon, there
   is growing uncertainty about what the future holds. The globe-trotting
   monk, now 83, decided last year to cut down on his travels, citing age
   and exhaustion.

   It is unclear who will succeed him when he dies, how that person will
   be picked or whether there will even be another Dalai Lama.

   Traditionally, the title is bestowed on the highest-ranking leader in
   Tibetan Buddhism. It is given to those deemed to be the reincarnation
   of a line of revered religious teachers.

   Asked in a recent interview with Reuters what might happen after his
   death, the Dalai Lama anticipated a possible attempt by Beijing to
   foist a successor on Tibetan Buddhists.

   In the interview, the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize laureate said: “In future,
   in case you see two Dalai Lamas come, one from here, in a free country,
   one is chosen by Chinese, and then nobody will trust, nobody will
   respect (the one chosen by China). So that’s an additional problem for
   the Chinese. It’s possible, it can happen.”

End of the line

   Such speculation is not new. The Dalai Lama once told the BBC that he
   might be the last person to hold the title, or that the next leader
   could be elected and not reincarnated.

   But his comments highlighted the dilemma facing the future of Tibetan
   Buddhism as its current leader heads into his mid-80s.

   China’s foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said in March the
   “reincarnation of living Buddhas including the Dalai Lama must comply
   with Chinese laws and regulations and follow religious rituals and
   historical conventions.”

   Beijing must have full control over the appointment of the next Dalai
   Lama to help strengthen its overall grip on the Tibetan community,
   which is deeply faithful to its spiritual leader.

   The Dalai Lama says he no longer seeks an independent Tibet, only its
   cultural autonomy, but China is not convinced. It reviles him as a
   traitor, “a wolf in monk’s robes” engaged in “anti-China separatist
   activities under the cloak of religion with the aim of breaking Tibet
   away from China.”

   In 2011, in a move to democratize the Tibetan government-in-exile, the
   Dalai Lama gave up his political and administrative powers to become
   just a spiritual leader, but he is still by far the community’s most
   influential figure.

   Even though he has set up a democratic structure for Tibetans in India,
   many are concerned their future may look bleak without the Dalai Lama
   to speak on their behalf.

India-Tibet divide?

   India is home to nearly 100,000 Tibetan refugees, some 73% of all
   Tibetans in exile.

   But many in recent years have questioned whether the host nation is
   distancing itself from the community and whether the Dalai Lama and his
   followers would get the same welcome today as they did in 1959.

   “India is sensing Tibet’s appeal in the West is declining,” said
   Tsering Shakya, a Tibet scholar and research chair at the University of
   British Columbia in Canada.

   Ultimately, current geopolitics are what matters most for India. China
   is vastly more powerful than it was 60 years ago, and India takes a
   pragmatic view of the relationship – an approach that could have a cost
   for the interests of exiled Tibetans.

   Celebrations last year to mark the start of the 60th anniversary were
   moved or canceled when asking senior leaders and government officials
   not to attend them.

   The note reportedly said that the events, in March and April, came at a
   “very sensitive time in the context of India’s relations with China.” A
   week later, the Tibetan Central Administration – the government in
   exile – decided to move a major cultural event from New Delhi to
   Dharamsala, where the exiled community is based.

   These are worrying developments for the community.

   “The current Indian stand towards the Tibetans is based on its
   relationship with the Dalai Lama,” Shakya said. “All the privileges
   afforded to the Tibetans on the ground, they are honoring an important
   and internationally recognized religious figure. This claim provides a
   moral legitimacy for the Indian government.

   “In the absence of the Dalai Lama, India cannot make a similar claim.”

   As China’s influence in South Asia rapidly increases and the Dalai Lama
   grows old and frail, the exiles in India can only worry and wait.

Bolivia’s former President Evo Morales returns home after a year in exile

   CNN  —

   Former Bolivian President Evo Morales returned to the country on Monday
   after spending almost a year in exile in Argentina.

   Morales, who ruled Bolivia for almost 14 years, fled on November 11,
   2019, amid accusations of electoral fraud. He denied the allegations
   and declared himself the winner of the October 2019 vote, but was
   eventually forced to step down before leaving the country.

   After a brief stint in Mexico, Morales had been living in Buenos Aires
   since December 2019.

   He decided to return to Bolivia after his fellow Socialist Luis Arce
   won the Bolivian presidential election in October. Arce was sworn in as
   Bolivia’s new president on Sunday.

   Arce, whom Morales had handpicked as his successor, has previously
   served as the country’s finance minister.

   “When I left, I said: ‘We will come back, and we will be millions.’ Now
   we are back and we are millions,” Morales said after walking across the
   bridge connecting Bolivia and Argentina in Villazon, Bolivia,
   accompanied by Argentine President Alberto Fernandez.

   The Bolivian interim government, which took power after Morales left
   the country, charged the former president with alleged sedition and
   terrorism, but the charges were dropped in October 2020.

   Morales has previously announced his intention to move back to his home
   region of Chapare in Central Bolivia; he plans to arrive there on
   Wednesday, exactly 365 days after he left the country.

   Morales, who was the country’s first indigenous president, led Bolivia
   for almost 14 years. He was credited with slashing poverty and
   overseeing rapid economic growth, but his popularity suffered amid the
   election-rigging allegations.

   Bolivia has been badly hit by the coronavirus. The economy is also
   struggling. Unemployment has spiked since the pandemic began, and the
   International Monetary Fund is predicting a nearly 8% drop in GDP this
   year.

   CNN’s Human to Hero series celebrates inspiration and achievement in
   sport. Click here for videos and features

Story highlights

   Hidetoshi Nakata became Japan's first footballing hero, starring at the
   1998 World Cup

   He is known as "Japan's David Beckham" for his celebrity status on and
   off the field

   In 2006, he made shock decision to retire after his third World Cup,
   aged 29

   He set off traveling the world ... and has now returned to learn about
   Japan
   CNN  —

   By the age of just 29, Hidetoshi Nakata was recognized by many as the
   greatest footballer Japan had ever produced. So why the glum look?

   “To be honest with you, it was not my dream,” Nakata admits, now, to
   CNN’s Human to Hero series, as he reflects on the emotions he was
   feeling at his third World Cup, in Germany in 2006.

   The fans, the media, his teammates: no-one managed to get behind the
   dark designer sunglasses.

   No-one understood why – at the end of a hard-fought defeat to reigning
   champions Brazil, which meant early elimination for Japan – the usually
   stoic Nakata lay down on the turf at the Dortmund’s Westfalenstadion
   and wouldn’t get up.

   “It’s unforgettable,” he says now – but still offers no more
   explanation.

   Meet 'David Beckham of Asia'

   That night, his face cracked with pain, Nakata wept under the
   spotlights.

   Little-known to any of the traveling Japanese fans assembled in the
   terraces that evening, Nakata – a player just reaching the height of
   his powers – had made a secret decision, six months before, to walk
   away from it all.

   Today

   When Nakata arrives to talk about World Cups and what he has been doing
   for the last eight years, he’s nattily dressed – leather jacket, smart
   slacks, brightly-colored socks – and even when out on the pitch, he
   juggles the ball on expensive-looking designer leather pumps.

   It’s not for nothing that he gets described as Asia’s answer to David
   Beckham.

   Like Beckham, the hairstyles are now more restrained – the
   attention-demanding red spikes are long gone – and like the English
   superstar, his reputation continues to extend far beyond his home
   country: both as Japan’s most gifted footballing export and an
   ambassador for Tokyo’s fashion industry.

   It took eight years in the wilderness – first wandering across the
   globe on a meandering journey of self-discovery that he estimates
   covered close to a hundred countries from Tanzania to Turkmenistan –
   but Nakata seems to have found himself.

   “All my life, I played just football. I didn’t know what the world was
   like outside of football,” he explains.

   “I wanted to know what’s happening now in the world, and what I could
   do for the world.”

   In his time away, Nakata – now 37 – appears to have resolved some of
   the contradictions that once made him the misunderstood man of Asia’s
   rising footballing generation.

   Like, why did the flamboyantly dressed star – followed wherever he went
   by battalions of newly galvanized Japanese soccer fans and screeching
   admirers, a man who led the first generation of sports stars to share
   their lives on the internet – plead so strongly for privacy?

   And why did a player whose evident love of the game changed perceptions
   of football in Asia give it all up?

   Having crossed the world looking for answers, he’s finding them closer
   to home. The one-time Calvin Klein underwear model who, for years,
   fought to escape his native country’s media, has returned home with the
   aim to visit each of Japan’s 47 prefectures, hoping to reconnect with
   the “real” people he is getting to know.

   “So many people, so many friends asked me about Japan but I couldn’t
   answer,” he says.

   “In the end, I just realized I didn’t know about Japan.”

   Today, fashion takes a back seat – although he still boasts an
   unmistakable, if now lower-key style – and the focus is on the
   traditional craft of his new job as a sake maker and self-appointed
   ambassador for Japanese culture abroad.

   “I have decided to travel in Japan to learn Japanese culture. So, last
   five years, I have been traveling all the prefectures in Japan, meeting
   craftsmen, farmers, sake makers and trying to see what are the best
   hotels and restaurants … you know, just to tell my friends.”

   Nakata the player

   Nakata arrived on the world stage at France ’98 – a willowy, nimble
   21-year-old with a peroxide orange crop of hair.

   He brought with him the Asian Footballer of the Year title (which he
   would win again the following year) and a defined reputation as a
   prickly interviewee off the field.

   His performances for Japanese J-League club Bellmare, and five goals
   for the national team in qualification for Japan’s historic first World
   Cup, had demonstrated a strong dribbling game and knack for ghosting
   into the penalty area to score goals.

   “The first match was against Argentina, which was very difficult – but
   at the same time I didn’t have anything to lose,” he recalls.

   Flying at full-tilt, making mazing runs through nano-scale gaps in the
   Argentine defense in the second half, Nakata looked like the rare sort
   of player who could make the difference even against the world’s best
   opposition.

   How pioneer Oliseh changed African football

   He’s a player who “never really had problems playing under pressure,”
   he admits.

   “I had a lot of motivation and, just like a small kid, it’s just having
   great toys to play with.”

   Journey to Italy

   Despite losing 1-0 in that match (and succumbing to one-goal losses in
   both the other group games) the debutants became favorites among
   neutrals for their classy, ball-down, passing play and desire to take
   games to vastly more experienced opponents – typified by Nakata.

   The next season would see him whisked off to newly-promoted Serie A
   hopefuls Perugia for $4 million amid reported bids from Manchester
   United, as he became just the second Japanese footballer to play in
   Italy’s top division.

   Critics screamed that the Umbrian club had bought a novelty act – a
   flash in the pan, buoyed by World Cup excitement. Nakata responded with
   silence off the field and by blowing away expectations on it – starting
   with two goals in a 4-3 loss to champions Juventus on the opening day
   of the season.

   “Going to Italy from Japan, obviously, culturally they are totally
   different, so it was very difficult to learn the Italian language and
   the lifestyle as well,” Nakata says.

   “But football is always the same – football is football all over the
   world – so I was just concentrating to play football.”

   He scored 10 times in his first season and soon earned a $29.5 million
   transfer to Fabio Copello’s title-challenging Roma side.

   In the final stretch of the 2000-01 season, he helped Roma come from
   2-0 down against a Zinedine Zidane-inspired Juve, scoring a spectacular
   strike before another long-range attempt led to the equalizer.

   The result proved crucial as Roma secured just its third league title
   since forming in 1927, and it earned Nakata another big-money move to
   Parma – where he won the Italian Cup the following season, scoring a
   crucial late away goal in the first leg of the final against Juventus.

   The joy of football

   His next two World Cup finals would take him from that highest high to
   the lowest low.

   Ex-Soviet footballer's trailblazing career

   In 2002, Japan and South Korea co-hosted as the tournament came to Asia
   for the first time.

   “It was very special because all the population in Japan was really
   expecting something,” Nakata says.

   “So we had to pass through (the group stages) for sure, even though we
   lost all three games in the 1998 World Cup.”

   After a draw against Belgium and a 1-0 win over Russia, Japan faced
   Tunisia in the final group game with all four teams still able to
   qualify. Heading into the last 15 minutes, the host nation had
   struggled to break through, but led 1-0 thanks to a reflex strike from
   substitute midfielder Hiroake Morishima.

   When fellow replacement Daisuke Ichikawa broke down the right and
   floated a high ball toward the back post, Nakata, with a sharp header,
   sent Japan through at the top of the group.

   “When we came out from the stadium, there were so many people outside
   the stadium clapping their hands and it seemed like all of Japan were
   there. And we were so proud of ourselves.”

   Love lost

   The years leading to the next World Cup would be characterized by
   full-blown “Nakatamania” – perhaps apt for a man who was inspired to
   play the game as a child by the popular Japanese cartoon character
   “Captain Tsubasa.”

   Wherever he traveled in Italy, a corps of 20-or-so Japanese reporters
   followed – sending back bulletins on his health, his hairstyle, and any
   hint of a scoop about his private life.

   The onlookers would have to be dragged away from training sessions and
   even friendlies against amateur sides would be beamed across the world
   to be shown live in Japan. Books about him sold in the hundreds of
   thousands.

   Nakata had long since stopped talking to the press – whose tabloid
   intrusions and tired questions had riled him as a young player in
   Japan. Instead he talked through his website Nakata.net, which was
   swamped with 15 million hits a day.

   All this attention was not missed by clubs.

   The reports of offers from Manchester United in 1998 had set off the
   uneasy relationship between Nakata the midfield maestro and – in the
   words of the New York Times’ Paddy Agnew – the “one-man tourist
   attraction and a small merchandising gold mine” he represented to
   owners.

   The rumors that year claimed the bids were backed by United shareholder
   Rupert Murdoch’s BSkyB satellite TV company with an eye to opening up
   deals in east Asia – without team boss Alex Ferguson’s knowledge.

   For years to follow, any club where Nakata pulled on the jersey could
   watch tens of thousands of replicas fly out the shop – mostly to
   Japanese tourists. Wherever he went, fans and press asked whether
   talent or commercial interests justified his presence.

   Why he walked

   After two and a half seasons at Parma, he went to Bologna and
   Fiorentina before finally ending up in England in August 2005.

   However, it was not in Manchester, or London – Nakata signed for
   distinctly unfashionable Premier League club Bolton Wanderers on a loan
   deal.

   The northern town – not far from Manchester, but better known as the
   birthplace of the ice cream wafer sandwich than for its fashion and
   culture credentials – represented even more of a culture shock to
   Nakata.

   “It was difficult to adapt to,” he would later explain in an interview
   with men’s style magazine GQ.

   Under manager Sam Allardyce, Nakata was pinned uncomfortably into a
   rigid 4-4-2 system and rarely allowed to wander freely, as he did at
   his best. After six months, his love for the game faded, and he made
   his secret pact to retire.

   Japan again

   Despite that early end to his top-level career, Nakata has always
   traveled with a pair of boots in his suitcase.

   He’ll be at the next World Cup – backed by his sake brand, to show off
   the Japanese culinary craft and alcohol making he’s learned about on
   his travels – and he’ll often be found playing in charity matches with
   old footballing friends from Italy and Japan.

   I think football is the best tool to communicate with other people, to
   connect the people.

   Hidetoshi Nakata

   Now he sees the game as a way to get to know people – and, perhaps, for
   people to finally get to know him.

   “I think football is huge. I think football is the best tool to
   communicate with other people, to connect the people,” he says.

   “It’s beyond the countries, it’s beyond languages.

   “Football is the biggest thing to share, to connect the entire world so
   … even outside the stadium, I can play football to connect the people.”

   Reuters  —

   After bolting to Ukraine to escape political persecution in her native
   Belarus, Olympic swimmer Aliaksandra Herasimenia never thought she
   would again be forced to flee, this time to save her family from
   Russian attack.

   Herasimenia, a three-time Olympic medalist, found herself among
   thousands of Ukrainians massing at the border with Poland as Russian
   troops advanced on Kyiv.

   On the second day of the Russian invasion last month, Herasimenia and
   her husband, Olympic swimmer Yauhen Tsurkin, scrambled to pack some
   belongings and set off on a 12-hour car ride to the Polish border with
   their young daughter and Herasimenia’s mother.

   With explosions resounding in the background as they inched along
   congested roads, Herasimenia reassured her three-and-a-half-year-old
   daughter, telling her it was only thunder.

   “Of course I had to make something up because how do you explain to a
   child that war has started?” Herasimenia, who is now in Warsaw with her
   family, told Reuters.

   Herasimenia was among the elite athletes who fled Belarus in the wake
   of a crackdown against those who protested what they said was the
   fraudulent re-election of Alexander Lukashenko in August 2020.

   Lukashenko, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has
   denied any wrongdoing.

   Russia has used Belarusian territory to launch a multi-pronged invasion
   of Ukraine, where many Belarusians settled after escaping persecution
   at home. Moscow says it is conducting a “special military operation” to
   disarm and “denazify” Ukraine.

   “We’ve been running for a long time,” said Herasimenia, whose family
   waited for nearly a day and a half at Ukraine’s border with Poland.

   “Those who left were the best of Belarusian society, those who were
   against what happened after the election, those who spoke out against
   the violence and expressed their position.”

‘Fighting for freedom’

   Herasimenia heads the Belarusian Sport Solidarity Foundation, a group
   that supports athletes who have been jailed or otherwise punished for
   their political views.

   These include Krystsina Tsimanouskaya, a sprinter who defected at the
   Tokyo Olympics last year after being removed from the Games against her
   will by coaches.

   wearing 'Z' symbol next to Ukrainian athlete

   Following a recommendation by the International Olympic Committee
   (IOC), several international sports federations have barred both
   Russian and Belarusian athletes from taking part in international
   events because of the invasion of Ukraine.

   The foundation has backed the decision to ban Belarusian athletes but
   says it supports efforts by those who voiced opposition to Lukashenko
   to compete independently.

   It is also determined to fight discrimination against Belarusians now
   that their country is viewed an “aggressor” by the public in many
   Western countries, Herasimenia said.

   “A year and a half ago, we were the ones who were fighting for our
   rights, our freedom,” said Herasimenia, who won silver in both the 100m
   and 50m freestyle at the 2012 London Games, and bronze in the 50m
   freestyle at the 2016 Rio Olympics.

   “We called on the Europeans, Americans and everyone in Ukraine for
   help. We warned that Lukashenko was very dangerous.

   “It’s as if this never happened … No difference is being made between
   those who support Lukashenko and those who fought against him.”

Afghan journalist in exile: “If I stop writing, I stop existing”

   After the Taliban takeover in Afghanistan in 2021, many journalists had
   to leave the country. DW Akademie offers scholarships, training and
   mentorships to support journalists in exile. We spoke to one of them*.

   *For safety reasons, we cannot disclose the name of the interviewee.
   They are one of the participants of the pilot project Space for
   Freedom. With this project, DW Akademie and local partner organizations
   are helping to create new perspectives for journalists and media in
   exile. Previously, the participant worked as a freelance journalist,
   columnist and analyst for the three biggest newspapers in Afghanistan,
   covering current issues and political developments in the country. The
   participant has also published articles with international media
   outlets such as the BBC.

   What happened to you when the Taliban seized power in August 2021?

   In Afghanistan, it was no longer possible to continue my work, due to
   heavy restrictions on media houses, censorship, arrests and all the
   other things happening at the time. When you work as a journalist and
   the political environment changes like this, there is no way for you to
   stay. Without freedom of speech, we couldn’t work anymore.

   I continue to work in exile, but I have to keep a low profile. Now I am
   part of a project that helps to keep me busy and not forget my passion
   and professionalism.

   Why is it important that journalists like yourself keep reporting from
   and about Afghanistan?

   I always say that we have to be the voice of the voiceless people.
   Right now, there is no voice from Afghanistan, so I am trying to raise
   a voice for the people. At least I am in a safer place than the people
   who are still in the country and I can talk about reality.

   I also think that you have to take notes. You don’t have to publish
   them right now, but you have to take notes. This is history happening
   right now and right there. So for journalists, it’s a duty to write
   down what has happened to Afghanistan. That will help the next
   generation and the international community to have a clear image of
   what is happening, not the story that the Taliban choose to tell. The
   reality that the people of Afghanistan are witnessing is something
   else.

   What are the greatest challenges for you as a journalist in exile?

   The biggest problem is our uncertain future: Now we are in Pakistan,
   our visas are expiring and there is no way to extend them. There is
   nothing promised for us or a safe place to go to. We face so many
   challenges, from financial to psychological problems. I have struggled
   with anxiety and depression for several months, lost over 15kgs of my
   weight during these last eight months.

   In exile there are daily struggles. You have to find a way to cover
   your expenses, to keep a positive mindset. Every day I wonder what will
   happen tomorrow, what do I do if there is no safe shelter? There is
   also no way back for us. I am on the list of wanted people, so if I
   cross the border, I will be arrested.

   And these are problems alongside the fact that you have lost friends,
   your career, everything. Some of us have ten years of journalism
   experience and it is worth nothing anymore now.

   What are the topics you are covering in exile?

   I have started working on two projects. The first was an interview with
   a journalist who is the founder and editor-in-chief of a news agency
   working in exile. I spoke to him about the challenges and obstacles,
   how difficult it is to find funding, etc.

   The second interview was with a female para-athlete from Afghanistan
   who is in Pakistan now. We spoke about athletics during the Taliban
   regime and the past government and how she thinks about her future. I
   am still working on this article.

   How did you come across DW Akademie’s project “Space for Freedom” and
   what have you learned so far?

   I read about the program on social media and some friends told me to
   apply. So far, we have had two trainings: Mobile journalism and digital
   security. Mainly I am a writer and not a photographer or a
   videographer, but the mobile journalism training was very useful for
   me. I have learned how to make short videos, short documentaries, take
   different angles for good shots.

   The training takes place online but every day we have some practical
   tasks. Then we send the videos to our mentors and receive feedback. I
   really feel that I am improving in this field.

   We also had the training on digital security. I have lost my blue badge
   Twitter account a few months back. If I had had that training earlier,
   I would have probably not lost it. Now I have learned to secure my
   accounts, I know which platforms and messengers to use for safe
   communication.

   So, I am focusing on training at the moment. When you are in exile, you
   are not in a good psychological place. Writing is somehow difficult,
   but I still try. If I stop writing, I stop existing.

   What are your plans after completing the training program?

   I am trying every possible way to get out of Pakistan. I am trying to
   find a scholarship, because I was doing my masters studies when the
   Taliban took over. So, I had to leave behind my studies and could not
   finish my degree. I’m also trying to find international media houses to
   work with, to keep myself busy but also to find a way to cover my
   expenses. It’s hard to be in exile without any funding.

   The main thing that helps about the training is that we also learn to
   write resumes and apply for international media houses. And we also
   have learned the standards to make videos for international media. We
   talk to our mentors and every week they give us advice on how we should
   write, how we communicate with editors.

   About the future of Afghanistan, I am very pessimistic. I have studied
   politics and I don’t see a bright future for Afghanistan at this
   point.

   What keeps you going even in this difficult situation?

   For me, two things give me energy: One is the hope that one day I will
   work with an international media house. And the second thing is my
   family. I have to move forward, for myself and my family.

Former Cote d’Ivoire militia leader Ble Goude back home after exile

   Charles Ble Goude, a former militia leader who was acquitted of crimes
   against humanity related to his role in Cote d’Ivoire’s civil war,
   returned from exile on Saturday as politicians sought to reconcile
   after years of instability and conflict.

   Hundreds of supporters wearing clothes printed with Ble Goude’s image
   sang and danced in the Yopougon suburb of Abidjan to welcome him home
   after eight years.

   The return of Ble Goude following his acquittal by the International
   Criminal Court in The Hague in 2019 is part of a wider rapprochement
   between political factions in Cote d’Ivoire, that President Alassane
   Ouattara hopes will reduce political tension ahead of elections in
   2025.

   “I dreamed of this moment from my prison cell,” Ble Goude told the
   crowd that stood in the pouring rain. “You will accompany me in this
   peace process that our country needs.”

   Much of Cote d’Ivoire’s tension stems from a brief civil war following
   a 2010 election, after which former president Laurent Gbagbo failed to
   accept defeat to Ouattara. Tensions have been simmering since and at
   least 20 people died in clashes when Ouattara decided to run again in
   2020 elections.

   Gbagbo, who was ousted during the civil war and was also acquitted of
   war crimes in The Hague, returned home last year after a decade in
   exile.

   Ble Goude, who headed the notorious Young Patriots street militia
   during Gbagbo’s presidency, was accused of inciting attacks on
   civilians and United Nations soldiers.

   He was sentenced in absentia to 20 years in prison by a court in
   Abidjan in 2019 for his role in the civil war. Ble Goude told Radio
   France International last week that he expects those charges to be
   dropped once he returns.

Napoleon abdicates the throne and is exiled to Elba

     *

     *
     *

   On April 11, 1814, Napoleon Bonaparte, emperor of France and one of the
   greatest military leaders in history, abdicates the throne, and, in the
   Treaty of Fontainebleau, is banished to the Mediterranean island of
   Elba.

   The future emperor was born in Ajaccio, Corsica, on August 15, 1769.
   After attending military school, he fought during the French Revolution
   of 1789 and rapidly rose through the military ranks, leading French
   troops in a number of successful campaigns throughout Europe in the
   late 1700s. By 1799, he had established himself at the top of a
   military dictatorship. In 1804, he became emperor of France and
   continued to consolidate power through his military campaigns, so that
   by 1810 much of Europe came under his rule. Although Napoleon developed
   a reputation for being power-hungry and insecure, he is also credited
   with enacting a series of important political and social reforms that
   had a lasting impact on European society, including judiciary systems,
   constitutions, voting rights for all men and the end of feudalism.
   Additionally, he supported education, science and literature. His Code
   Napoleon, which codified key freedoms gained during the French
   Revolution, such as religious tolerance, remains the foundation of
   French civil law.

   Downfall

   In 1812, thinking that Russia was plotting an alliance with England,
   Napoleon launched an invasion against the Russians that eventually
   ended with his troops retreating from Moscow and much of Europe uniting
   against him. In 1814, Napoleon’s broken forces gave up and Napoleon
   offered to step down in favor of his son. When this offer was rejected,
   he abdicated and was sent to Elba. In March 1815, he escaped his island
   exile and returned to Paris, where he regained supporters and reclaimed
   his emperor title, Napoleon I, in a period known as the Hundred Days.
   However, in June 1815, he was defeated at the bloody Battle of
   Waterloo. Napoleon’s defeat ultimately signaled the end of France’s
   domination of Europe. He abdicated for a second time and was exiled to
   the remote island of Saint Helena, in the southern Atlantic Ocean,
   where he lived out the rest of his days. He died at age 52 on May 5,
   1821, possibly from stomach cancer, although some theories contend he
   was poisoned.

   DEBATE HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR REFUGEES
   STATEMENT BY MR. NICOLAS DE RIVIERE,
   PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE OF FRANCE TO THE UNITED NATIONS
   AT THE SECURITY COUNCIL

   New York, November 2, 2022

   Mr. President,

   I would like to thank Mr. Grandi for his speech and especially for his
   remarkable work at the head of the office of the United Nations for the
   High Commissioner for Refugees.

   As you mentioned, Mr. High Commissioner, this year we have reached the
   sad record of 100 million displaced persons throughout the world. The
   causes of these displacements are diverse: the multiplication of
   conflicts, the worsening of food insecurity and malnutrition in the
   world, climate change. Displaced women and girls also suffer from
   specific difficulties that we must address: access to sexual and
   reproductive health, exposure to higher risks of sexual violence.

   In this context of crisis, UNHCR’s mandate remains more fundamental
   than ever and I would like to salute the remarkable work, courage and
   dedication of all the staff of the Office.

   Since the beginning of Russia’s illegal aggression against Ukraine,
   Europe has experienced the largest displacement of people in the world,
   the largest since World War II, with 7.5 million refugees and 6.5
   million internally displaced people. In response to this tragedy,
   France is doing its utmost: it has pledged 200 million euros in
   humanitarian aid, welcomed more than 100,000 Ukrainians and provided
   schooling for more than 20,000 children who have fled the war. France
   will continue to support the UNHCR’s action in support of the millions
   of displaced Ukrainians, in particular to protect them from the
   combined effects of the war and the cold winter.

   Support for Ukraine in no way diminishes the attention given to other
   humanitarian crises. France is fully mobilized to respond to other
   emergencies, particularly in the Sahel and the Middle East. As of 2021,
   we have doubled our voluntary contributions to the UNHCR and are now
   the 8th largest donor. Similarly, France is assuming its share of
   responsibility by resettling refugees on its territory and receiving
   people in need of protection. Providing assistance to people forced
   into exile is a duty.

   We must do everything we can to help countries that are on the front
   line of large-scale displacement. It is only through a solidarity-based
   approach that we will be able to improve the care of refugees and
   displaced persons. In this context, the threats to food security and
   nutrition impose a duty of solidarity. France is mobilized through the
   FARM initiative, the "Save crops" operation and the European solidarity
   corridors.

   It will co-sponsor the next World Refugee Forum at the end of 2023.
   This meeting should allow for greater cooperation in the reception of
   refugees and the strengthening of asylum systems throughout the world.

   Finally, we will not compromise with the fundamental principles
   concerning the return of refugees. In Syria, the regime is sorting out
   the refugees, thus continuing by other means its policy of demographic
   engineering carefully implemented since the beginning of the conflict.
   This is why I repeat: the conditions for a dignified, safe and
   voluntary return are not met. Only the regime can remove the obstacles
   to return. It is essential that the UNHCR be able to ensure effective
   monitoring of Syrian refugee returnees and the conditions for their
   return.

   Finally, Mr. President, it is up to this Council to create the
   conditions for a lasting settlement of the crises, in order to address
   the root causes of population displacement.

   I thank you

An Iranian Exile Channels Her Trauma Into Film

   Zar Amir Ebrahimi, who had to flee Iran after an intimate tape was
   leaked, has been transfixed by the protests erupting there as her film
   “Holy Spider” is released in the U.S.

   “I sometimes think, for an actress, I’m happy to have this much pain in
   my life,” said Zar Amir Ebrahimi, adding, “I put everything into the
   movie, all my life.”

   Roger Cohen

   By Roger Cohen

   The writer reported from Iran at the time of the 2009 protests, and
   from elsewhere in the region. He reported from Paris for this
   interview.
   Oct. 22, 2022

   “I know that fear, I know that humiliation,” Zar Amir Ebrahimi, the
   winner of the best actress award at this year’s Cannes Film Festival,
   said in a recent interview. “I know how men in Iran use their power to
   keep you quiet.”

   Ebrahimi is an Iranian exile who, in 2008, decided she had to flee
   after being subjected to a smear campaign based on her love life. Now,
   that experience and her role in the film “Holy Spider,” which opens in
   theaters in the United States on Oct. 28, have intersected with
   disarming intensity, as women in Iran burn their head scarves to
   protest the oppression of the Islamic Republic.

   The story of Rahimi, the fictional investigative journalist at the
   heart of “Holy Spider,” is one of female defiance in the face of male
   violence. Based on the true story of Saeed Hanaei, a serial killer who
   preyed on prostitutes in the Iranian city of Mashhad, a religious
   center, the movie traces with unflinching, sometimes harrowing,
   intimacy Rahimi’s efforts to penetrate the world of men obfuscating
   Hanaei’s crimes.

   “We need to finish this story,” Ebrahimi said, her pale eyes burning,
   during the 75-minute interview in Paris. “This Islamic Republic has to
   end. Women today know their rights. They know what life and freedom of
   expression are. It will take time and blood, but there is no other
   way.”

   It took time and flexibility to make “Holy Spider,” which is directed
   by Ali Abbasi, an Iranian exile based in Copenhagen. Filming was
   impossible in Iran, given the government’s hostility to the project,
   and months of preparation in Turkey came to nothing when the Turkish
   authorities, apparently under pressure from Tehran, blocked the
   production. The young Iranian actress who was set to play Rahimi
   withdrew, abruptly overcome by fear of reprisal, just as filming was
   about to start in Jordan, according to Ebrahimi.

   “I got so angry with her,” said Ebrahimi, who was then the casting
   director for the movie. “And I think that night when I got so crazy,
   I’m pretty sure that Ali saw something in me.”

   So, in extremis, Ebrahimi, 41, who found fame in the early 2000s as a
   star of the Iranian TV soap opera “Narges,” took on the lead role.
   Given all of these obstacles, it is, Ebrahimi told me, “a miracle that
   we have it to screen.”

   Abbasi, the film’s director, said he wanted to challenge the image of
   “the Islamic Republic and its leaders as some sort of theocratic, dry
   people who are very conservative.” At a deeper level, he suggested,
   “these people are obsessed with sexuality.” Iran is a country, he said,
   where the authorities “get some sort of pleasure out of humiliating
   women.”

   For the director, who visited Mashhad as part of his preparations for
   the movie, “there is a Lynchian undercurrent of fetishized suppressed
   sexuality in every aspect of the Islamic Republic.”

More on the Protests in Iran

Cities across Iran have been embroiled in demonstrations prompted by the
death of a young woman, Mahsa Amini, while she was in police custody.

     * A Women-Led Uprising: Casting off their legally required head
       scarves, Iranian women have been at the forefront of the
       demonstrations, supplying the defining images of defiance.
     * Showing Their Support: From World Cup soccer players to movie
       personalities, high-profile Iranians are increasingly making public
       gestures of support for the protests.
     * The Crackdown: Witness accounts and a Times video analysis reveal
       how Iran’s security forces are co-opting ambulances to infiltrate
       demonstrations and detain protesters.
     * Fire and Fury: Protesters set fire to the childhood home of the
       Islamic revolution’s founder, Ayatollah Khomeini, after a wave of
       anger erupted over the government’s killing of children.

   His words brought to mind a meeting I had in the holy Iranian city of
   Qum in 2009. A mullah sat on a raised dais as he explained in measured
   terms the rationale of the Islamic Republic. Then the subject turned to
   women. How could any man not lose control, he suddenly frothed, if
   women’s hair and the curves of their bodies were allowed to be seen in
   public? This was the gateway to hell, he shouted.

   Ebrahimi’s life as an actor in Iran had fallen apart a few years before
   that meeting, when a video of lovemaking she said she had made with her
   boyfriend at the time was leaked by a friend, another actor, who
   somehow stole it when at their apartment. It became known as the “sex
   tape case,” and the hounding of Ebrahimi knew no bounds.

   “All these people were watching my naked body and just kept copying the
   video and selling it in the street,” she said. “And I had to lie every
   day and just say it was not me, and I can’t tell you how painful it all
   was. Not because I was ashamed of what I did, but because of the
   betrayal from my colleagues and this whole society.”

   The government set about finding every man with whom she had shaken
   hands, or been photographed, she said; every man she had ever kissed on
   the cheek. It was clear her career in Iran was over. She was about to
   confront her various accusers in court, facing a prison sentence and 97
   lashes on the charge of having sexual relationships outside wedlock,
   when she decided to flee.

   Ebrahimi flew to Azerbaijan, she said, and later from there to Paris,
   where she has since built a life. She has not returned to Iran, where
   most of her family still lives, and became a French citizen in 2017.

   returned.Credit...Elliott Verdier for The New York Times

   In recent weeks, as antigovernment protests have spread across Iran and
   more than 200 people have been killed, Ebrahimi has been transfixed.
   Watching a new generation resisting arrest and shouting, “I don’t want
   this hijab, what’s your problem with my hair?” has given her hope.

   “I saw these images of three actresses throwing away their hijabs,
   saying we don’t want to lie anymore, we don’t want to hide ourselves,”
   Ebrahimi said, “and I figure if they arrived at this point, the whole
   of society is kind of there.”

   At the same time, she says she knows that the guardians of the Islamic
   Republic will resist to the end. “The last foundation they have for the
   regime is women and imposing the hijab,” Ebrahimi said. “They believe
   if the hijab comes off, everything will be destroyed — the Islamic
   Republic will tumble down.”

   Ebrahimi said she felt a lot of emotion that her film was arriving in
   American theaters at the same time as the protests; it feels like “all
   these things are happening in the same direction,” she said.

   “We can’t be controlled by them anymore,” Ebrahimi said. “We can’t hide
   ourselves and play this game. We grew up learning how to lie. There are
   84 million people in Iran, and they are 84 million actors. Lying,
   existing inside and outside. Lying inside to our parents that we didn’t
   meet someone outside, lying outside that we don’t party inside.”

   In making the film, Ebrahimi drew on these experiences of being
   humiliated by an oppressive government. Her trauma became a source of
   inspiration and resolve.

   Rahimi, determined to find the murderer who keeps dumping strangled
   women on the outskirts of town, and driven by the memory of how an
   overbearing male editor had abused her, encounters forms of male
   contempt and evasion.

   She meets a mullah who assures her that every effort is being made to
   solve the crimes, even as he hints that it may be God’s will that these
   female sinners be eliminated. She encounters various men who form a
   protective shield around the killer, admired in his community as a
   husband, father and war veteran. She confronts a police officer who
   comes to her hotel room and tries to seduce her, dangling the
   possibility of information for sex.

   “We worked on that scene with the policeman for two hours, and I saw
   that I could link my personal experience of life to this journalist,”
   Ebrahimi said. “She was living inside me, and you know, improvisation
   is an important part of Ali’s work. I came up with the idea of the
   memory of harassment by a colleague and editor as the motivating force
   for the journalist.”

   today know their rights,” Ebrahimi said about Iran, where protests have
   erupted recently. “They know what life and freedom of expression
   are.”Credit...Elliott Verdier for The New York Times

   Ebrahimi, who received threats from the Islamic Republic soon after she
   won the award at Cannes, including an allusion by the culture ministry
   to the fate of the author Salman Rushdie, said that the impact of
   living in Iran “affects men, too. If they drink or not, if they read
   something or not — there is this continuous pressure to deceive.”

   Hanaei’s crimes were called the “spider killings” by local news media
   because of how he carried them out. He confessed to killing 16 women,
   and was executed in 2002. In “Holy Spider,” the character is played
   with psychological intricacy by Mehdi Bajestani. He is desperate to
   believe that he is doing God’s will, and that of the Islamic Republic,
   by killing prostitutes. The pressure on him grows. He snaps at his
   wife. He feels suspicion growing.

   “I think he’s kind of a victim of the whole society, of the whole
   mind-set,” Ebrahimi said.

   At one point, his wife surprises him at home after a murder. He
   hurriedly wraps the corpse in a carpet. His wife finds him tense and
   impenetrable; she coaxes him to have sex. On top of his wife, sweating,
   thrusting, he sees the foot of the strangled prostitute sticking out
   from the carpet.

   “He has something of what I call Travis Bickle syndrome,” Abbasi said,
   a reference to the hero of “Taxi Driver.” “Back from a war, in an
   existential black hole, missing the violence. And in that scene, sexual
   pleasure and violence juxtapose each other.”

   “It’s a movie about a serial killer,” Ebrahimi said, “but also about a
   serial-killer society. I know, because at some point, I got killed
   actually by each person in that society, except perhaps 10 percent who
   still had my back.”

   She continued: “I sometimes think, for an actress, I’m happy to have
   this much pain in my life, to have experienced this sex tape story. I
   put everything into the movie, all my life.”

   When at last Rahimi finds the killer by impersonating a prostitute, he
   asks her name.

   “Zahra,” she says, falsely.

   “This was pure improvisation,” Ebrahimi said. “It was not in the
   script. I said ‘Zahra,’ which is my real name, even if I don’t use it
   anymore.”

   Ilya Ponomarev has long been a thorn in the side of Russian president
   Vladimir Putin.

   From leading street protests over his re-election in 2012 to being the
   only MP to oppose Moscow's annexation of Crimea, Ponomarev's position
   is clear.

   Only now it's more extreme, a consequence of Russia's invasion of
   Ukraine.
   (BUTTON)

   Exiled in Kyiv, the 47-year-old says he is a spokesman for the National
   Republican Army (NRA), an underground group that wants to violently
   overthrow the Russian leader.

   Among others, the NRA claims to be behind the car bomb that
   killed Darya Dugina, the daughter of ultra-nationalist Alexander Dugin.

   “Obviously, the end game is regime change in Russia,” Ponomarev told
   Euronews from the Ukrainian capital Kyiv. “You need to destroy the
   system so it does not repeat itself. That can be done only violently.
   There is no other way because the people around Putin will fight.”

   However, experts have cast doubt on the existence of the NRA, saying
   there is little coordination of protests and attacks in Russia.

NRA 'is diverse and decentralised'

   Russian-born Ponomarev, once a member of the Communist Party of Russia,
   served as an MP from 2007 to 2016.

   Before being exiled due to his opposition to Russia's land grab of
   Crimea, he had worked with Dmitry Medvedev, president from 2008-2012.

   “I saw Medvedev as a window of opportunity, and I still think that it
   was, but when Putin asked him to swap back again, he agreed,” said
   Ponomarev, referring to Putin returning as president in 2012 after
   standing aside to avoid term-limit rules. “I think that it was possible
   to reverse Russia's path if Medvedev had stayed, but it didn’t happen
   and Russia continued on an irrevocable and irreversible path that we
   are seeing the consequences of now.”

   Granted Ukrainian citizenship in 2019, Ponomarev says it became
   clear that working within the Russian system cannot change anything.

   After the outbreak of war, he launched a news outlet called February
   Morning, which aims to give a voice to Putin's critics.

   Now he helps the NRA -- which he says consists of around 500 to 1,000
   people and is diverse and decentralised to avoid infiltration -- with
   advice and assistance.

   He also claims to be helping Ukraine and has connections to other
   partisan groups operating in Russia.

   “You know, the people who are criticising me [for not criticising
   Russia's leaders earlier and his links with Medvedev], they have done
   nothing radical, and they are doing nothing,” said Ponomarev.

   “They have done nothing but wish. I have at least done everything
   possible to change the situation with all the tools that the system
   gave me.”

Russian elite 'needs to feel like they are in danger'

   Ponomarev says part of his strategy is to split the Russian elite,
   arguing Russia's oligarchs are almost only interested in money and
   being safe. As long as supporting Putin is safer than supporting
   change, nothing will happen, he adds.

   Therefore he wants to make it unsafe for the Russian elite so that they
   will be ready to switch sides.

   "They do not like what is happening with the war, but they are doing
   nothing because there is no real danger to their position," he said.
   "That needs to change.”

   The next step, adds Ponomarev, is to make Russians feel they can hit
   the streets and protest.

   After any revolution, he believes there is a need for a transition
   government, tasked with strengthening the rule of law and implementing
   reforms.

   Corrupt politicians and civil servants in all layers of society will
   have to be removed and replaced, he adds.

   He also thinks leaders of any revolution, such as himself, refrain from
   running in any democratic elections that may follow.

   “And I think that the people, like me, who are involved in the
   transition government should take an obligation, promising not to run
   after the transition period is over,” says Ponomarev. “I am definitely
   ready myself to make such an obligation.”

The NRA could be just 'a fantasy'

   Experts, however, have cast doubt over whether the NRA is a fantasy.

   "I am not fully convinced that the National Republican Army exist,"
   said Sergey Radchenko, an expert on Russia from the Johns Hopkins
   School of Advanced International Studies.

   "There are protests in Russia and attacks on recruitment offices and
   infrastructure, but I don't see much organisation to it.

   "It makes me think that the National Republican Army is not a reality,
   but maybe fantasy.

   "There are non-state groups operating around the world, but I don't see
   any evidence yet that it is the case in Russia.

   "Everything is, of course, possible, but I haven't seen any evidence
   and it makes me suspicious.

   "In absence of evidence, I am sceptical... I cannot rule out that they
   exist but it is not just true because Ponomarev says so.

   "We have to be cautious and that is the whole point."

Afghanistan: exile is the only way for Freshta to stay alive

   rights defender, started a new life in Belgium with her mother and
   young siblings.

   Freshta is a strong woman, but in Afghanistan that is often not enough.
   ‘Without OMCT's support, I would not be alive today,’ she says.
   Freshta, who since her teens has been a staunch defender of human
   rights, has always refused to give in to her country’s patriarchal
   society. But when the Taliban arrived at her home with machine guns,
   she had no choice but to flee.

   Threats and harassment—the life of a family without a man in
   Afghanistan

   Freshta, 23, has never had many options. When she lost her father at
   the age of 12, she was left with a sick mother, a younger brother and a
   sister. Women and minors are not allowed to own property, so Freshta's
   uncles took their inheritance. Freshta had to work to bring home food.

   In Afghanistan, a family without a man is a family in danger. In the
   eyes of Afghan society, Freshta’s duty was to marry to ensure her
   family’s protection. Refusing to do so meant suffering continual
   harassment: ‘Everywhere I went, I had to hide the fact that my father
   was dead, otherwise men would ask me to marry them and threaten to call
   the Taliban.’ But it’s hard to keep that kind of secret in a country
   where a man is needed for all formalities, for every journey. Freshta's
   family was marginalised and lived in constant danger. After seven years
   of struggling, exhausted, she gave in. ‘I had no choice but to give up,
   I couldn't fight any more.’

   ‘Behind my back, I heard a Taliban shouting: she's running away!’

   At 19, Freshta got engaged to a man she had never met. ‘I thought I was
   out of the woods, but I soon realised that my life would be even
   worse.’ He was a violent drug addict and already had another wife.
   Freshta refused to marry him, and so the threats started again. Her
   fiancé's family was powerful and was prepared to go to any length to
   ruin Freshta—including knocking her down with a car. Freshta was
   injured. ‘I told my colleagues that it was an accident, but I saw my
   father-in-law-to-be at the wheel.’

   Freshta's fiancé knew the Taliban well. When they took over Afghanistan
   in August 2021, Freshta and her family were terrified. One day, the
   armed group burst into the courtyard of their building, shouting:
   ‘Allahu Akbar.’ Freshta realised they were looking for her. ‘I was only
   scared of one thing: that they would catch me alive.’ She ran out the
   back door, followed by her mother, brother and sister. ‘We had a narrow
   escape. Behind my back, I heard a Taliban shouting: “She's running
   away!” I still have nightmares about it.’

   Giving a voice to Afghan women ‘who have no voice’

   Freshta and her family hid with friends, but it was an unstable and
   dangerous solution for their hosts: ‘Our bank accounts were blocked,
   but the OMCT provided us with the financial support to go to a hotel.’
   Our teams also obtained visas for the family of four—all of whom were
   in grave danger—to leave Afghanistan. Freshta says what touches her the
   most is knowing that someone, somewhere, cares about her: ‘OMCT is a
   family to me.’ She recalls her first meeting with Maria, our Human
   Rights Defenders Support Officer, at Brussels airport: ‘I hugged her so
   hard it must have hurt her.’

   Today Freshta lives in Belgium with her family, where she finally has a
   choice. ‘I went back to school to study entrepreneurship, and I
   continue to give a voice to Afghan women who have no voice.’ Freshta
   believes that Afghanistan is being held hostage by the Taliban's
   patriarchal rule and that it’s up to Afghan women, who are living this
   injustice first-hand, to liberate the country. ‘We need more women
   human rights defenders in Afghanistan,’ she says.

   Thanks to your donations, we are working to support these women who
   continue to make their voices heard despite the obstacles. Thank you
   for fighting with us for a fairer world for all.

   Every year, dozens of journalists are forced to leave their homes under
   threat of imprisonment, torture, violence, or even death, because their
   work has angered the powerful. Over the past 12 months, the Committee
   to Protect Journalists has supported 42 journalists around the world
   who were forced to flee, with Syria, Ethiopia, and Eritrea responsible
   for the most cases of exile. These are some of their stories.

   Most of the journalists CPJ has assisted in exile had little or no
   warning that they would be forced to flee, to undertake a journey of
   trauma and uncertainty. While their experiences have much in common
   with ordinary refugees, CPJ research shows that journalists’ high
   profiles leave them particularly vulnerable to certain dangers and that
   the persecution they faced at home often follows them across borders.
   Furthermore, the media community left behind is often intimidated into
   self-censorship and the public deprived of information. CPJ is
   releasing its annual survey of journalists in exile to mark World
   Refugee Day, June 20.

   While each journalist in exile has a unique tale to tell, every
   reporter, broadcaster, photojournalist, videographer, editor, blogger,
   and media worker forced to flee experiences similar dangers and must
   overcome similar milestones to reach any new semblance of normal life.
   This timeline looks in detail at the journeys into exile of eight
   journalists from around the world who fled their homes in recent years
   and sought support from CPJ. All of their comments are from interviews
   with the organization.

The Journalism

   Some exiled journalists become targets after publishing or broadcasting
   one sensitive story. CPJ research shows that such stories are usually
   on politics, corruption, crime, war, or violence.

   Iran Iran

   In 2010, an Iranian investigative reporter and photographer, who did
   not wish to be named in order to protect his security, began
   interviewing the families of protesters killed or arrested during the
   demonstrations that followed Iran’s 2009 disputed presidential
   election. While conducting the interviews for a documentary, the
   journalist received a series of anonymous telephone calls inquiring
   about the film and accusing him of having ties to the foreign press, he
   said. At least one caller threatened the journalist’s family.

   “They told me to stop working for the media, because working for the
   media would cause further headaches for me. The caller said ‘…You want
   to be safe, don’t you? You want your family to be safe, don’t you? All
   kinds of things could happen when people step out onto the street.’ He
   told me not to work for the media until further notice.”

   Omwa Ombara Omwa Ombara

   Kenyan freelance reporter Grace Ombara covered politics and was admired
   for her integrity-she refused to accept a bribe from a local politician
   seeking favorable news coverage. She wrote about corruption in the 2007
   election and the ensuing violence that killed 1,200 people. Later, she
   was approached by the International Criminal Court (ICC) as a potential
   witness in the court’s investigation into the deadly aftermath of the
   vote.

   After word got out that Ombara had been approached by the court to
   testify, the journalist began receiving threats. These escalated from
   ominous calls and text messages to unidentified individuals following
   her in the street.

   Other journalists endure years of harassment and threats in response to
   their work before the persecution escalates to the point that they feel
   they have no choice but to flee.

   Mir Zabibhullah, an experienced Afghan reporter who began working when
   he was 15 years old, started investigating and reporting on crimes of
   war in 2007. The journalist said he received threats during this time,
   but nothing that scared him enough to stop his work.

   In 2013, when Zabibhullah, now in his mid-thirties, began to focus on
   warlords running for government positions, the harassment escalated.
   “As a journalist who was completely aware of the situation and had
   evidence, it was my responsibility to write about it. I couldn’t stop
   myself,” he said.

   On October 19, 2013, Zabibhullah’s articles on warlords appeared in the
   Afghanistan Monitor newspaper, in print and online, as well as on the
   Ariana Television Network.

   When Zabibhullah received a threatening call that same day, he did not
   take his assailants seriously at first. He said he had accepted that
   such warnings were a normal part of journalism in Afghanistan, and he
   was determined not to let them prevent him from working.

The Decision To Leave

   Fear of physical retaliation is the main reason journalists give for
   fleeing their homes. About half of the 404 journalists whom CPJ has
   assisted over the past five years cited fear of violence as their
   reason for leaving. In fact, Somalia, Syria, and Sri Lanka, which
   account for a quarter of CPJ’s exiled assistance cases, are all ranked
   among the top five countries on CPJ’s Impunity Index, which spotlights
   countries where journalists are murdered regularly and their killers go
   free.

   On October 19, 2013, the same day that Zabibhullah’s most recent
   articles on corruption were published, he received a phone call
   demanding he hand over all his work, including notes and documents. He
   responded by asking how he should go about doing so, in an effort to
   find out who was calling. The line went dead, and Zabib turned off his
   phone and continued with his scheduled meetings for that day. He turned
   his phone back on hours later to find numerous missed calls from an
   unknown number, as well as calls from his boss and his mother.

   The journalist was told that armed men claiming to be from the
   government had come to the office looking for him. Zabibhullah’s boss
   asked him to work from home and avoid the office for his safety.

   When Zabibhullah spoke about calling his mother, his voice cracked as
   he described the feeling of hearing his mother cry for the first time
   in his life. He explained, through sobs, how he found out that men in
   military uniform came to his home searching for him. They entered the
   house and demanded to see where Zabibhullah kept his documents. In
   front of his wife and small children, they started a fire, destroying
   all his work.

   The men left, and his wife tried to put out the fire. With difficulty,
   Zabibhullah described how he arrived at the hospital to find his wife’s
   arms and face bandaged because of the severe burns she had suffered.
   “It was the worst experience of my entire life,” he said.

   That night, Zabibhullah fled with his wife and two children to
   Pakistan.

   “I have to leave my homeland, the country that I love, my home, my
   career that I love,” he said.

   The other most common reason cited by journalists for fleeing is fear
   of imprisonment. Two countries who consistently jail journalists for
   their work, Iran and Ethiopia, are responsible for sending into exile
   about a quarter of the journalists CPJ has assisted over the past five
   years.

   Despite continued threats and legal harassment in reaction to her
   reports on government corruption, Frederica Jansz had no intention of
   ever leaving Sri Lanka. She had spent 20 years working as a journalist,
   building a career as a dogged newspaper reporter.

   In July 2012, Jansz’ lawyers told her there was a good chance that her
   passport would be confiscated by the court and that she could face jail
   time because Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the defense secretary (and brother of
   the president), was pursing court action against her.

   The Sunday Leader newspaper,where Jansz was editor-in-chief, had
   published an article alleging the misuse of government funds by
   Rajapaksa. In response, Rajapaksa revived a contempt of court action he
   had filed in 2009 after Jansz reported critically on the government.
   Jansz said that Rajapaksa also threatened and cursed her over the phone
   when she had called to inquire about the use of government funds.
   Still, Jansz did not consider leaving her home or her career-even
   though her predecessor as editor-in-chief, Lasantha Wickramatunga, had
   been murdered on his way to work on January 8, 2009. (Nobody has been
   prosecuted for the crime.)

   Even when the United States ambassador called her and advised her to
   leave the country, Jansz responded, “I’m not going anywhere.” The
   journalist had been offered a multiple-entry visa to the U.S. after
   receiving threats in 2009. “I was shocked. I had no intention of using
   it. I did not want to leave,” she said.

   In September 2012, Jansz was fired from her position at the Sunday
   Leader, but Rajapaksa threatened to continue with litigation against
   her in her private capacity. Soon after losing her job, Jansz said, she
   was followed home by men on motorbikes on at least two occasions.

   Terrified, Jansz decided that now she had no choice.

   “In the end, I had to go-not for me, but for my children,” she said.

   Quietly and without saying goodbye to anyone, the journalist packed
   some clothes and boarded a plane with her children for the U.S.

   One month after Jansz arrived in the U.S., the Sri Lankan Court of
   Appeals issued a warrant for her arrest.

Where to Go

   Once journalists realize they have no choice but to flee, many seek
   initial refuge in a neighboring country, where the border is easy to
   cross and visa requirements minimal or nil. From there, they register
   as refugees with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
   (UNHCR) or with the appropriate government agency, with the aim of
   being formally resettled, usually to a third country. But the
   registration process is often long and cumbersome.

   The procedure in each country varies, and the rules can change
   mid-stream, further compounding confusion. Even after a journalist has
   successfully registered as a refugee, the date they receive for their
   resettlement interview is often one or two years in the future. And it
   is nearly impossible for exiled journalists to receive updates on the
   status of their case.

   Iran Iran

   One Eritrean journalist, a producer at the state-run Radio Bana, whose
   name CPJ is withholding to protect his safety, was detained in December
   2012, two days after he spoke at a conference on reporting he had
   conducted on the educational system in Eritrea and how it marginalized
   and isolated the minority ethnic Bilen community, which is not taught
   Tigrinya, the national language.

   After the producer was arrested at his home in Asmara, Eritrea’s
   capital, he said, he was taken to prison and accused of harboring
   anti-state feelings and of spying; he was hung upside down and tied up
   while officers beat his legs. Eritrea is Africa’s worst jailer of
   journalists and the world’s worst abuser of due process, according to
   CPJ research; no Eritrean journalist detainee has ever been publicly
   charged with a crime or brought before a court for trial.

   When the producer was released from prison six months later, he was
   summoned by the Ministry of Defense to report for service-an indefinite
   assignment in Eritrea. A trusted friend in the ministry told the
   journalist that a letter had been received that said, “We are
   transferring this person to your unit because he has sub-nationalistic
   feelings. Keep watch on him.”

   Fearing for his life, the producer traveled to the remote village where
   his parents lived. He kept a low profile for seven months, until his
   father was approached by a village administrator who asked why his son
   had returned. The journalist then fled on foot to Sudan, stopping only
   briefly to say goodbye to his wife and children. The journey took him a
   week.

   Sudanese police patrol regularly to round up Eritreans trying to cross
   the border. “If you pay them, you will be released,” the journalist
   said. “If you’re wanted by the Eritrean government though, they may
   turn you over.”

   The journalist believed his name would be recognized; he was terrified
   of being stopped and sent back to prison. Even in Khartoum, Sudan’s
   capital, he felt unsafe surrounded by so many exiled Eritreans. “I did
   not know who to trust,” he said. He traveled by car and on foot to
   South Sudan, passing several checkpoints and bribing officers to let
   him pass, before reaching the White Nile river and boarding a boat for
   a five-day journey to Juba, the capital. The entire trip took two
   weeks, but the journalist’s journey is not over. There is no UNHCR
   office in South Sudan, so he will have to cross another border if he
   wants to register as a refugee and apply for resettlement.

   Some journalists have the means to travel directly to the country where
   they intend to apply for asylum, eliminating the UNHCR resettlement
   process. Still, they are not usually able to immediately settle down
   and restart their lives. They must begin the lengthy, and sometimes
   expensive, process of applying for asylum.

   Once in Pakistan, the Afghan reporter Zabibhullah paid a smuggler
   US$20,000 to help him escape. He was taken to Karachi, where he boarded
   a flight to Dubai, where he was given a passport. He then flew to
   Denmark and eventually made his way to Landskrona, a small town in
   southern Sweden, where he is now.

   But Zabibhullah left his wife and children behind in Pakistan, where he
   believed they would be safer than they would in the care of a smuggler.
   Zabibhullah said he hopes to bring his family to Sweden as soon as he
   is granted asylum, but in the meantime he cannot find work and has
   struggled with anxiety, depression, and guilt concerning his family.
   “It tortures me that I put them in that situation,” he said.

   In yet another scenario, some journalists are deported from their home
   country after being released from prison.

   Rodríguez Saludes Rodríguez Saludes

   Cuban photographer Omar Rodríguez Saludes served seven years of a
   27-year prison sentence. He was arrested in 2003, along with 28 other
   reporters and editors, during a massive crackdown on Cuba’s independent
   press-a period known as the “Black Spring.” In 2010, after negotiations
   with the Catholic Church and the Spanish government, Cuban President
   Raúl Castro agreed to release 52 political dissidents, including
   journalists, on the condition that they leave Cuba for Spain
   immediately. The day he was let out of prison, Rodríguez Saludes was
   put on a plane to Europe.

   “Leaving Cuba was the most painful process,” Rodríguez Saludes said.
   “It was very traumatic. I felt my life was being ripped out. From one
   day to another you are in a prison cell and then you are in Spain. At
   first, I didn’t want anything to do with this. But the Cuban state
   security was smart and they used my family. They brought them to speak
   to me, and I had no choice. … And it was so difficult to go from a
   place where you don’t even see the grass grow to a plane where the
   entire crew is welcoming you to freedom.

   “There were so many police taking me onto the plane. There were even
   police officers on the stairs leading up to the aircraft. And then, on
   the plane, the Iberia crew was waiting to welcome me. They welcomed me
   back to freedom and to democracy. After living so long alone, it was
   very emotional to be welcomed into freedom. As soon as the plane took
   off, the captain announced that [I] and another independent journalist
   were on the plane-that we had been in prison and were now on our way to
   freedom. I will never forget that day.”

New Country, New Hardships

   Once journalists who cross the border into a neighboring country have
   registered as refugees, they can apply for resettlement to a third
   country. CPJ data show that nearly 60 percent of journalists assisted
   over the past 12 months went through this process in a country of first
   refuge.

   As they wait among the community of refugees from their own country,
   journalists are extremely vulnerable because their work has made them
   recognizable. In many cases, journalists in exile continue to be
   targeted by their home governments, whose agents infiltrate refugee
   communities abroad. In some cases, home governments target the
   journalist’s family left behind. And in other cases, insurgent groups
   who forced journalists to flee in the first place continue to threaten
   and attack them, especially if the journalists keep reporting on
   sensitive topics.

   Abdifatah Elmi Abdifatah Elmi

   In August 2008, Somali photojournalist and cameraman Abdifatah Elmi was
   working as a fixer with Canadian reporter Amanda Lindhout and
   Australian photographer Nigel Brennan in a refugee camp outside
   Mogadishu when they were kidnapped at gunpoint. Abdifatah was held for
   nearly five months before being released with threats to not to discuss
   his kidnapping or continue reporting. (The international journalists
   were held for 15 months.) Abdifatah said he was told, “If we miss you
   when you are let out, your family is here.” Realizing he would not be
   able to safely continue his work in Somalia, he fled to Kenya, leaving
   behind his wife and four children.

   Abdifatah described his fears as a Somali refugee in Nairobi, where he
   continues to try to make his living as a journalist. In March 2014, six
   months after the attack on the city’s Westgate Mall that killed 67
   people, Kenya’s Ministry of Interior ordered all refugees to be
   relocated to refugee camps, a dangerous location for exiled
   journalists, CPJ research shows. “[Refugee] camps are not safe because
   there is no security, no police,” Abdifatah said. “Everyone knows who
   you are.” He and others in Kenya say the militant insurgent group
   Al-Shabaab, believed to be responsible for the murders of many Somali
   journalists at home, has penetrated the camps. Ethiopian journalists
   exiled to Kenya are also targeted by the directive; they fear the
   presence of Ethiopian security agents in the camps.

   At least 21 Somali and Ethiopian journalists were arrested in Nairobi
   during March and April 2014, according to CPJ research. Most used the
   little money they had to bribe their way out of the camps.

   “I can’t go anywhere. I can’t go to the camps, I can’t go back to
   Somalia. This is the worst situation,” Abdifatah said. “Every night, in
   the middle of the night, they knock on doors. You can’t sleep-you can’t
   imagine.”

   Only 28 percent of refugee applicants were granted resettlement to a
   third country in 2013, according to data made public by the UNHCR.
   Those granted resettlement, including journalists, may still wait
   several months to several years to reach their destination, depending
   on the demand for assistance.

   Iran Iran

   The Iranian journalist who was threatened after interviewing the
   families of killed protesters, fled Iran in August 2012. He arrived in
   Turkey on a Sunday. On Monday, he went to the UNHCR office in Ankara
   and stood in line outside to submit a request for resettlement. “We
   waited it out until the afternoon,” he said. “They took our passports
   and returned [them] to us an hour later with two sheets of paper. In
   one of the papers was written an introduction to the city police
   department.” He said the second paper stated they would be considered
   for enrollment in six months.

   Finding a place to live was difficult. The journalist did not speak the
   local language and tried to communicate in English, a language he did
   not know well. He went with his family to the police department whose
   address they had been given; after being interviewed, they received a
   temporary residence card. One week later, he was able to rent an
   apartment.

   In December 2012, the Iranian journalist and his family had their first
   interview with the UNHCR and were officially registered as refugees.
   Almost a year later, in October 2013, his family was interviewed for
   resettlement.

   He said, “All this time, my wife and I, as two journalists, were almost
   secretly living in Turkey. We never had comfort and confidence to
   continue our jobs in Turkey because I would prefer that none of our
   former colleagues in Iran know our location.” He said he believes one
   of his colleagues informed the secret service in Iran of his
   activities. Even though he is out of the country, he still feels
   vulnerable-a common sentiment among Iranian journalists in exile,
   according to CPJ research.

   The journalist has continued to record videos for an Iranian newswire,
   but he does not use his real name. “I even got verbal warning a few
   times from the Turkish police to stop any activity on movies and news
   videos, because they are afraid of my camera and they think I am
   engaged in political activities against the Turkey government,” he
   said.

   Exiled journalists who go straight to the country where they apply for
   asylum also go through a difficult waiting period. Some journalists try
   to continue working while finding their footing in a new country, only
   to find that they face persecution by authorities in that country as
   well.

   mohamed_al-aweid mohamed_al-aweid

   Mohamed al-Aweid is an experienced journalist who served as the
   regional director of the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) in
   the city of Daraa and reported for the official national daily Syrian
   Baath Newspaper. He was detained because of his reporting in June 2011
   and again in May 2012, and accused of sharing secrets with the
   political opposition outside the country. After being released the
   second time, the journalist, fearing more harassment and prison time,
   fled Syria.

   Al-Aweid went to Jordan, where he registered as a refugee with the
   UNHCR and was directed to the Zaatari refugee camp. After several
   months there, al-Aweid bribed a security official to be allowed to
   leave the camp. He went to Amman, the capital, to continue his work as
   a journalist-first as an editor, then as a presenter for the TV channel
   Syria Al-Shaab, an opposition outlet that broadcasts via satellite and
   the Internet. He also reported for the opposition news website Zaman
   Altawasol. But several months after al-Aweid began appearing on TV,
   Jordanian intelligence officers summoned him and warned him that in
   Jordan he was a refugee and not a journalist, and that if he continued
   to work he would be sent back to Syria.

   Forced to stop working, al-Aweid had no income and no way to support
   his family. He began to look for another destination. In June 2013 he
   filed an asylum claim for his family at the French embassy in Jordan.

   Journalists who flee into exile sometimes arrive with no support
   network to cushion the fall of landing suddenly in a foreign country.

   Omwa Ombara Omwa Ombara

   Ombara, the Kenyan journalist who was threatened after being approached
   by the International Criminal Court about testifying on post-election
   violence, did not intend initially to come to the U.S. At first, she
   sought refuge with a friend; then she moved into a safe house for
   witnesses set up by the Kenyan Witness Protection Agency. But when word
   leaked that she might testify, the ICC said she could no longer be a
   witness in its investigation-which meant she no longer qualified for
   the government’s protection. But the threats did not subside.

   Ombara fled to the U.S. in February 2013 and stayed briefly with
   friends in Washington D.C. before moving to Pennsylvania, where a
   relative lived. In June 2013, having no place to stay after her
   relative’s home proved too small, Ombara entered a women’s shelter,
   where she lived for the next six months. During this time, the
   journalist had her passport and wallet stolen. “It is not what I
   expected of America,” she said.

   She is now out of the shelter and applying for asylum in the U.S., but
   is frustrated by not being able to work and earn money. “For a
   professional like me, to become destitute, you don’t know what to do. …
   I never had to ask for help to buy soap. I used to give away soap. It
   is humiliating for me to ask.”

   “To make things worse, the people who put you through this are going on
   with their life,” Ombara said.

   One of the worst factors of exile for journalists is the difficulty of
   continuing their career. Even once they have documentation allowing
   employment, language is a barrier for many. About 20% of journalists
   assisted by CPJ have continued to work in journalism after going into
   exile.

   Rodríguez Saludes Rodríguez Saludes

   Rodríguez Saludes, the Cuban photographer who arrived in Spain in July
   2011, struggled to support himself and his family. He has since
   relocated to the U.S. and lives in Houston, Texas, with his wife and
   three children.

   “I’ve not really tried to get in touch with media here. I don’t really
   know why. Maybe it’s a complex I have because I don’t speak good
   English. At first, I ran those errands. I went to [Spanish-language TV
   network] Univisión, and I filled out an application. But I was quickly
   overwhelmed by the need to find a job, to make ends meet, so that fell
   by the wayside when I was able to find work at a hotel helping put
   together events.

   “There is a large Cuban community in Houston, but it’s not tight. I
   mostly see five people who were part of the Group of 75 [Cuban
   dissidents arrested during the Black Spring] and live in Houston. We
   are in touch and we stay together. … It’s harder with the rest of the
   community in Houston. Most of the Cubans who are here are interested in
   redoing their lives. Their thinking is very different from ours. We
   still think about Cuba and forming a new democratic country, freeing
   Cuba. They are mostly thinking about working and making money that they
   can then send back to Cuba.”

An Uncertain Future

   Exile is an enduring condition. In most cases, journalists who flee
   their countries do not have a clear vision of the future until many
   years later. Though none will ever be at home, some journalists are
   granted asylum and are able to rebuild their lives.

   image image

   Jansz, from Sri Lanka, received asylum in the U.S. exactly one year
   after submitting her application. “Despite the nightmare that was the
   last two years, I love my country,” she said recently. “I dreamt about
   it every night and cried.” …

   “It took me 20 years to get to where I was in my career. I am 46 [and]
   starting over.”

   Zabibhullah, the journalist forced to flee Afghanistan, said,

   “I was just trying to help other people who are victims and now what is
   happening is that I am a victim and my family is suffering somewhere
   else in the world.”

   He is waiting for his asylum application to be approved in Sweden.

   Omwa Ombara Omwa Ombara

   Ombara, the Kenyan journalist living in Pennsylvania, is waiting to
   hear if she has been granted asylum in the U.S. She said she wishes she
   could meet other journalists who have come to the country before her,
   but at the same time she is wary of other Kenyans in her city, not
   knowing whom she can trust. But the biggest struggle has been finding a
   way to survive:

   “How do you move on when you can’t work?”

   mohamed_al-aweid mohamed_al-aweid

   In December 2013, al-Aweid, the Syrian, was granted asylum in France,
   but the cost of transporting his family was his responsibility. He was
   able to buy plane tickets with the support of CPJ and partner
   organizations, and arrived in February 2014. He said images of the
   Syrian war haunt him and that “life remains difficult despite all the
   beautiful things because half of our souls remain in Syria.” Still, his
   children are attending school, the family is learning French, and
   Syrian acquaintances in France are helping them adapt to the new
   country.

   METHODOLOGY: CPJ’s annual exile report counts only cases who have been
   supported by the organization’s Journalist Assistance Program. CPJ uses
   this research, combined with expert analysis, to identify global
   trends. The survey includes only journalists who fled due to
   work-related persecution, who remained in exile for at least three
   months, and whose current whereabouts and activities are known to CPJ.
   The survey does not include the many journalists and media workers who
   leave their countries for professional opportunities, or to flee
   general violence, or those who were targeted for activities other than
   journalism, such as political activism.

   Since 2001, CPJ has documented the cases of 340 journalists forced into
   exile after their reporting exposed them to harassment, violence, or
   imprisonment. They face many difficulties in their new homes, from
   language and cultural adjustments to emotional and economic hardships.
   Here are five snapshots of journalists in exile.

   DINA YAFASOVA

   Reporter, Sygeplejersken (The Nurse)

   Yafasova (Courtesy Dina Yafasova) Yafasova (Courtesy Dina Yafasova)

   Country of origin: Uzbekistan

   New home: Denmark

   Date of exile: 2001

   Reason for leaving: Yafasova fled after she was threatened with
   imprisonment during an interrogation at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
   in Tashkent. She was questioned about a 2001 article in the Danish
   journal Sygeplejersken. Written under a pseudonym, the article
   described her experiences with government censorship. Two men also
   assaulted Yafasova on the street, taking her notes, tape recorder, and
   audiotape.

   Life in exile: Yafasova won asylum in Denmark in 2002 and was joined by
   her family. She has continued writing but has suffered the effects of
   her persecution in Uzbekistan. Eventually, she spent 11 months at the
   Centre for the Rehabilitation of Torture Victims in Copenhagen. Her
   2006 book “Diary from Sandholm” describes her experiences in a Danish
   refugee camp in 2001.

   On the freedom of exile: “Exile freed me from shackles. In exile, I
   could achieve a much greater degree of human freedom, which never could
   be achieved under dictatorship in my homeland. And this feeling of
   being a free person has a much bigger value for me than a feeling of
   belonging to the place where I was born.”

   SALEEM SAMAD

   Samad (Pavel Rahman) Samad (Pavel Rahman)

   Correspondent,
   Bangladesh Observer

   Country of origin: Bangladesh

   New home: Canada

   Date of exile: 2004

   Reason for leaving: Samad was under constant surveillance by military
   security forces following his January 2003 release from prison, where
   he had spent two months on antistate charges. The accusations stemmed
   from his work with a documentary crew for Britain’s Channel 4
   “Unreported World” series. In 2004, security agents raided his home,
   questioning his family about his whereabouts, and threatening to
   “greet” him at the airport if he returned from a conference in Canada.

   Life in exile: Samad opted to remain outside the country and to seek
   asylum, which he won in January 2005. His family joined him in Canada
   in 2006, and he has held various non-journalism jobs since—as a
   security guard, a concierge, and a salesman. Once a prominent voice in
   Bangladesh, he was met with closed doors when he tried to continue
   working for Bangladeshi papers while in exile. He now contributes
   pieces to expatriate news Web sites and runs the pro-democracy blog
   Bangladesh Watchdog.

   On the professional cost of exile: “After I lost my steady job with the
   Bangladesh Observer, the international press stopped requesting
   contributions of articles about the region.”

   MESFIN TESFAYE

   Editor-in-Chief, Abay

   Country of origin: Ethiopia

   New home: Kenya

   Date of exile: 2007

   Reason for leaving: Tesfaye fled from the harassment and threats that
   followed his release from prison in 2007. He had spent 18 months in
   custody on antistate charges stemming from critical coverage of a
   flawed 2005 election. Tesfaye was under regular surveillance and was
   receiving phone calls warning that if he “acted against the
   constitution,” he would be killed.

   Life in exile: Tesfaye has spent the past year in Nairobi, awaiting
   refugee resettlement through the United Nations High Commissioner for
   Refugees. In November 2007, Tesfaye and two fellow exiled journalists
   were assaulted in their apartment by men they believe were Ethiopian
   government agents. Tesfaye and his exiled colleagues keep a low
   profile. Unable to find work, they rely on small contributions from
   international organizations and family members in the diaspora.

   On the hardest part of life in exile: “Survival. There is no work here
   in Nairobi. You ask: Where will I get money? You are worried so much.
   Then you are forced to ask somebody, forced to be a beggar.”

   Gonzalez Raga (Agence France-Presse) Gonzalez Raga (Agence
   France-Presse)

   ALEJANDRO GONZÁLEZ RAGA

   Freelance reporter

   Country of origin: Cuba

   New home: Spain

   Date of exile: 2008

   Reason for leaving: González Raga boarded a flight to Spain immediately
   following his February release from prison, where he had served five
   years of a 14-year sentence on a charge of threatening “the territorial
   integrity of the state.” He was among 29 writers and editors jailed in
   the Cuban government’s March 2003 crackdown on the independent press.
   His release, along with that of fellow reporter José Gabriel Ramón
   Castillo, followed negotiations between the Spanish and Cuban
   governments. Prior to those talks, CPJ provided the Spanish government
   with information supporting the reporters’ release. Life in exile:
   González Raga is now publishing his prison writings, and he makes
   occasional contributions to Spanish media outlets. He struggles to
   provide for his seven family members in Spain, although he still seeks
   to have his father and a son, both of whom remain in Cuba, join him as
   well.

   On the emotional adjustment after prison: “When you are unjustly
   imprisoned, when you are taken away from your family, there are no
   tools to mend the pain.”

   ARASH SIGARCHI

   Blogger and editor

   Country of origin: Iran

   New home: United States

   Date of exile: 2008

   Reason for leaving: Sigarchi escaped to the United States while on
   medical leave from prison in Rashat, where he was serving a three-year
   sentence on charges that included espionage, engaging in propaganda
   against the system, and undermining national security. The charges
   followed interviews he gave to BBC World Service radio and the U.S.
   government-funded Radio Farda.

   Life in exile: Sigarchi lives outside Washington and has applied for
   political asylum. Unable to get employment while his work permit is
   being processed, and in need of assistance to cover living and medical
   expenses (he developed mouth cancer in prison), Sigarchi depends on
   help from friends and contributions from human rights organizations. He
   is learning English and hopes to further his media studies and to
   teach.

   On the decision to go into exile: “Maybe you expect I’d complain about
   exile, but I’m satisfied here because this is my choice. I had two
   options: one, to stay in Iran and be in prison under torture, and two,
   to be in exile.”

   The Torch is a weekly newsletter from the Committee to Protect
   Journalists that brings you the latest press freedom and journalist
   safety news from around the world. Subscribe here.

   Journalists forced to flee their countries face many challenges,
   including physical attacks and threats to family members they left
   behind. In some cases, they are pushed out of their professions
   completely. In a new feature released ahead of World Refugee Day, CPJ
   examines the risks facing journalists in exile, with recommendations on
   how nations, the UN, and media organizations can assist journalists
   seeking emergency relocation.

   A new report on the 2007 murder of Pakistani journalist Zubair Mujahid,
   from CPJ and other leading press freedom organizations as a part of A
   Safer World for the Truth initiative, finds significant errors in the
   official police investigation. The groups joined in a call for an
   independent re-investigation of the case to bring the killers to
   justice.

   High numbers of local journalists have fled several African countries
   in recent years after being assaulted, threatened, or imprisoned,
   leaving a deep void in professional reporting. The starkest examples
   are in the Horn of Africa nations of Somalia, Ethiopia, and Eritrea,
   where dozens of journalists have been forced into exile. Zimbabwe,
   Rwanda, and the Gambia have also lost large segments of the local press
   corps in the face of intimidation and violence.

   Those who flee their native countries pay a high price: Facing
   cultural, language, and legal obstacles, they struggle to find work in
   their profession. CPJ research shows that only one in three is able to
   continue working as a journalist. But the public also pays dearly for
   the exodus of professional, local reporters from these countries, all
   of which have had internal strife with international implications. Not
   only had domestic audiences relied upon these front-line journalists,
   so too had international reporters, who used local coverage as a base
   of information and depended on local reporters for the sort of sources
   and knowledge only a native can have.

   Yet it is not simply a shortage of reliable information that has
   resulted, journalists say. Perversely, in some instances, the exodus of
   professional journalists has enabled governments or political factions
   to exert editorial control over once-independent news outlets. “The
   high exile rates of journalists have not brought a lack of information
   so much as misinformation,” said Abdiaziz Hassan, a local correspondent
   for Reuters in Somalia. “It incites the conflict further.”

   Among the hardest hit has been Radio Shabelle, a Somali station that
   had earned a reputation for independent reporting. Situated in
   Mogadishu’s Bakara Market—home to a number of media outlets, but also a
   base of operations for the militant insurgent group Al-Shabaab—the
   station has seen five of its journalists killed, numerous staffers
   threatened, and several forced into exile. Without sufficient
   management on site, the station has been susceptible to pressure from
   Al-Shabaab to censor its coverage and even broadcast the group’s
   propaganda, according to Mohamed Amin, a former Shabelle deputy
   director now in exile.

   In all, CPJ has documented the cases of 30 Somali journalists who have
   gone into exile this decade, the fourth-highest tally worldwide during
   the period. CPJ’s data on exiled journalists include only those
   journalists who fled due to work-related persecution, who remained in
   exile for at least three months, and whose whereabouts and activities
   are known. Local organizations using different criteria report higher
   numbers. The Union of Exiled Somali Journalists, for example, counts as
   many as 80 exiled reporters. Most of these exiles have fled in the face
   of astonishing violence: Twenty-one Somali journalists have been killed
   in direct connection to their work since 2005, some at the hands of
   government forces, many at the hands of militant groups such as
   Al-Shabaab.

   Here’s another common thread: Most of the exiled Somali journalists
   speak English. That’s no coincidence, noted former Shabelle reporter
   Ahmednor Mohamed, who said insurgents have targeted English-speaking
   journalists in Mogadishu as “spies.” That, in turn, has a domino effect
   on international reporting.

   Among international news outlets, only the satellite channels
   Al-Jazeera and Al-Arabiya maintained an ongoing presence in the country
   in late year. Paul Salopek, a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter who has
   covered the continent for many years, noted that few international
   journalists even venture into Somalia, particularly Mogadishu, because
   of the severe risks. International correspondents are forced instead to
   report by phone from Nairobi, Kenya. “That’s how isolated we’ve become
   from the story on the ground,” said Salopek, who called war and drought
   conditions in Somalia “one of the worst humanitarian crises in the
   world.” Without reliable local reporters to provide baseline
   information, the task of telling the Somali story to the world has
   become extraordinarily difficult.

   “There’s little question that the decimation of Somali journalists—by
   assassination or through exile—has reduced the quantity and quality of
   news coming out of that country,” Salopek said. “They were the first
   responders, if you will, to breaking news in Somalia. And most of them
   are gone.”



   In Ethiopia and Eritrea, mass imprisonments of journalists early in the
   decade have been followed by years of steady repression. The threat of
   jail has led at least 41 Ethiopian journalists and 24 Eritreans into
   exile, CPJ data show, although local groups suggest the figures may be
   much higher.

   Ethiopian authorities have regularly used the law as leverage against
   the press, enacting two pieces of legislation in 2009 that further
   repress news coverage. An antiterrorism measure sets prison terms of up
   to 20 years for anyone who “writes, edits, prints, publishes,
   publicizes, or disseminates” statements that the government vaguely
   describes as advancing terrorist interests. The deceptively named Mass
   Media and Freedom of Information Proclamation stiffens penalties for
   libel and grants government prosecutors authority to censor
   publications on national security grounds.

   For an Ethiopian press corps that saw 13 of its colleagues jailed in a
   massive 2005 crackdown, the passage of new, restrictive legislation
   sent a clear message: The government of Prime Minister Meles Zenawi was
   again ready to imprison critical reporters and editors. “Everything
   became illegal,” said Wondrad Debretsion, an Ethiopian editor who
   recently went into exile. “Even state-sponsored reporters have started
   fleeing the country.” The continuing exodus has weakened the
   independence of the remaining Ethiopian press. The Awramba Times, a
   once critical publication, has taken a newly sympathetic stance toward
   the government, said Debretsion, who served as the paper’s deputy
   director before leaving the country in July.

   No government has decimated the press corps as thoroughly as that of
   Eritrea, where in 2001 the administration of President Isaias Afewerki
   rounded up 18 critical editors and reporters, jailed them without
   trial, and held them in secret locations. The crackdown pushed other
   independent reporters into exile, and effectively shuttered the
   independent press. The government’s heavy-handed repression has also
   forced out state-employed journalists, one of whom, Paulos Kidane, died
   while trying to flee the country on foot for Sudan in 2007.

   Gambian authorities have also used intimidation tactics: Seven editors
   and reporters were jailed for a month in 2009 on trumped-up charges of
   sedition; journalist “Chief” Ebrima Manneh was believed to be held in a
   secret government jail; and the government continued to show little
   interest in solving the 2004 murder of editor Deyda Hydara. Such
   tactics have prompted at least 13 journalists to flee since 2007,
   according to the Gambia Press Union. That number becomes eye-opening
   when one considers that the Gambia has just two independent newspapers
   and a population of 1.7 million. The journalists who remain often
   censor their work or simply avoid sensitive topics.

   “There is no incentive for in-depth reporting or investigative
   journalism anymore as it can land one in trouble with authorities,”
   said Musa Saidykhan, a Gambian journalist who fled after being tortured
   by state security agents in 2008.

   Government harassment has also played a role in Rwanda, where at least
   10 independent journalists have fled. Half of those journalists had
   contributed reporting to foreign media outlets, CPJ research shows.
   Robert Mukombozi, a Rwandan whose work as a correspondent for the
   Ugandan daily The Monitor had offended authorities, was ordered out of
   the country in 2009 on fabricated charges that he lacked citizenship.
   Lucie Umukundwa, a correspondent for the U.S. government-funded Voice
   of America, left in 2006 after unidentified men attacked her brother in
   reprisal for her reporting.

   “I was used to arrests and intimidations,” Umukundwa told CPJ, “but
   this was the first time my family was attacked.”

   Only two independent weeklies remain in Rwanda’s capital, Kigali. The
   director of one of those papers, Charles Kabonero, said the loss of his
   colleagues has not only lowered professional standards, it has left
   remaining journalists feeling isolated and less interested in pursuing
   independent stances. The private weekly Rushashya, which had been known
   as a critical news source, publicly announced in 2009 that it would
   take a more pro-government editorial stance.



   Many exiled African journalists face great challenges and continuing
   risk. The Union of Exiled Somali Journalists said about half of its
   members eke out a precarious existence on the dangerous streets of
   Kenya’s capital, Nairobi. Most fled so precipitously that they took few
   belongings or identification papers. The exile union, along with the
   National Union of Somali Journalists, both said they had received
   reports that Somali exiles have faced arbitrary harassment and
   detention at the hands of Kenyan police.

   The Rwandan Mukombozi told CPJ that members of his family had been
   assaulted twice in Kigali after he was forced into exile. “All that
   psychological pressure more than triples when such incidents happen,”
   he said by e-mail, “and the restricted communication between the exiled
   journalist and his/her family makes the harm on both sides enormous.”

   Gambian journalists seeking refuge typically move to Dakar, Senegal,
   but they are rarely at ease because of the suspected presence of
   Gambian security agents, said Demba Jawo, former head of the Gambian
   Press Union. “Sometimes exiled Gambian journalists feel compelled to
   move periodically to avoid detection from these security agents,” he
   said.

   Even those in safe circumstances face enormous professional challenges.
   At least 48 Zimbabwean journalists have been forced into exile since
   2000, most of them in the early half of the decade during sustained
   harassment by President Robert Mugabe’s government, according to CPJ
   research. In interviews with CPJ, many of these Zimbabwean journalists
   have said that it took years for them to re-establish themselves
   professionally and secure sound economic footings for their families.
   Many had to abandon journalism as a career.

   Yet some who revived their careers also created a vibrant diaspora news
   media. Gerry Jackson, an exiled Zimbabwean journalist, launched the
   London-based SW Radio in 2001. The station broadcasts programming into
   Zimbabwe in English and in the Shona and Ndebele languages. Wilf
   Mbanga, another exile, started The Zimbabwean newspaper in 2005. Based
   in his new home in England, Mbanga produces a weekly that circulates in
   the United Kingdom, South Africa—and Zimbabwe. Abel Mutasakani, who
   left for South Africa in 2004, joined with other colleagues to start
   the Web publication ZimOnline.

   Ethiopian and Eritrean exiles have similarly launched Web sites,
   typically focusing on events back home. While limited in what they can
   report firsthand, these sites receive and report leaked documents,
   interview disaffected government sources, and offer critical political
   commentary.

   The irony that exiled journalists are getting independent news and
   views into their native countries is not lost on people such as the
   Zimbabwean Geoff Hill. “Since nationalizing the press in 1981, Mugabe
   has done his best to control the flow of information, but now there are
   so many leaks in the bucket, it is more like a watering can,” said
   Hill, himself an exiled journalist who still reports on the country.
   “Much of the credit for this must go to the hard breed of Zimbabwean
   journalists—both at home and in exile—who refuse to surrender.”

   Torture. Denial of medical care. Repeated interrogations and
   accusations of collaborating with enemies: Yemeni journalist Youssef
   Ajlan’s story of his detention, which lasted over a year, hews closely
   to those of many journalists imprisoned for their work.

   This month, CPJ published its annual prison census, which found that
   governments around the world are holding at least 262 journalists
   behind bars for their reporting.

   But CPJ never listed Ajlan on the census, because he wasn’t jailed by
   an internationally recognized government and therefore wasn’t covered
   under our methodology. Rather, he was detained by the Ansar Allah
   movement, commonly known as the Houthis–technically, a non-state actor.

   Yet the Houthis have detained dozens of journalists and are currently
   holding at least 13, according to CPJ research. If the Houthis were
   considered a governing authority, Yemen would have the fifth highest
   number of journalists in jail in the world, after Eritrea and ahead of
   Azerbaijan and Vietnam.

   The effect on the climate for media, and the flow of information to the
   public, is the same, whether the entity enforcing such brute censorship
   is an internationally recognized government or not. The Houthis’
   detentions of journalists has silenced those who wouldn’t toe the line,
   according to one freelance Yemeni journalist who asked not to be
   identified for security reasons.

   “My colleagues and I think that there [is] no real reporting from
   inside the capital or anywhere Houthis are controlling,” the freelance
   journalist said.

   CPJ has documented how all sides in Yemen’s conflict commit abuses
   against journalists, and how the disintegration of state structures and
   accountability have further amplified the threats. The freelance
   journalist told CPJ that in addition to being attacked by the Houthis,
   he received criticism online from the Houthis’ opponents — members of
   the government run by President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi and based in
   Aden.

   The Houthis have risen from a rebel group based in the mountainous
   north to controlling the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, and effectively taking
   over what remained of the Yemeni national government. After
   consolidating their hold on Sanaa in September 2014, the group seized
   control of the main intelligence and security agencies, including the
   National Security Bureau and the Political Security Organization –which
   according to a report to the U.N. Security Council were competing yet
   feared instruments of state control under former President Ali Abdullah
   Saleh (Hadi’s predecessor, who was killed this month). Then they
   started detaining journalists.

   On June 9, 2015, nine journalists were detained at the same time when
   Houthi fighters raided a Sanaa hotel where they had gathered because it
   offered electricity and internet access:
     * Abdulkhaleq Amran, Islah Online
     * Hesham Tarmoum, Mareb Press newspaper
     * Hareth Hameed, Al-RabeaNet news website
     * Akram al-Waleedi, Al-RabeaNet news website
     * Essam Balghaith, Nass FM radio station
     * Hisham al-Yousifi, Yemen Tube website
     * Haitham al-Shihab, Al-Ahali newspaper
     * Hassan Anaab, Yemen Shabab TV channel
     * Tawfiq al-Mansouri, Al-Masdar newspaper

   According to Mwatana Organization for Human Rights, an independent
   human rights NGO based in Sanaa, these nine are being held in a Sanaa
   prison run by the Political Security Organization and their cases were
   transferred to a criminal court on June 17, 2017.

   Since then, the Houthis have detained four more journalists, including:
     * Salah Al-Qaedy, of Suhail TV channel, on Aug 28, 2015, held in the
       Political Security Organization’s Sanaa prison
     * Hussein Saeed Al-Easi, of Nahthat Watan newspaper, on Feb 18,2016,
       held in the Sanaa al-Thawra Temporary Prison
     * Abdullah Al-Munifi, of Al-Sahwa net news website, on Feb 18,2016,
       held in the Sanaa al-Thawra Temporary Prison
     * Abdel-Raheem Mohsin, who freelanced for a number of outlets such as
       news websites Al-Hadath and Yemen Voice, on August 24, 2017. CPJ
       was unable to determine where Mohsin is being held.

   CPJ was not able to determine the status of those four cases under the
   Houthi-controlled institutions.

   Ajlan, who had worked as a reporter for the newspaper and news website
   Al-Masdar from 2008 until 2015, was arrested October 16, 2016 and
   released November 23, 2017. He told CPJ that he was beaten and subject
   to ill-treatment, particularly during the first month of his detention;
   his Houthi captors questioned him repeatedly, punched and kicked him,
   and beat him with a stick all over his body. He said they later tied
   his arms and legs to an iron rod and suspended him from between two
   desks.

   “They asked me about my work as a journalist and my contact with
   journalists outside the country,” Ajlan said. He said he had been
   detained by the Houthis for several hours on March 26, 2015, and had
   stopped working in media after this first detention.

   Ajlan said he was held in six different locations, and suffered from
   stomach ailments and urinary tract infections but was denied access to
   medical care, forcing his family to bring him medication prescribed by
   doctors outside of prison. Houthi authorities often barred his family
   from visits, he said.

   CPJ could not independently verify Ajlan’s account of his treatment in
   detention. CPJ emailed Mohammad Abdulsalam, spokesman for the Ansar
   Allah movement, with questions about the treatment of journalists in
   areas under the group’s control, but has not received a response.

   “Even though I told them that I had stopped working as a journalist and
   had bought a taxi in order to support my family, they rejected
   everything I said and accused me of being an agent for Saudi and
   American aggression,” Ajlan said, referring to his second detention of
   over a year.

   Aside from the arrests, there is the disappearance of journalist Waheed
   al-Sufi, the editor-in-chief of the Yemeni weekly al-Arabiya. Al-Sufi
   was abducted by unidentified gunmen in Sanaa on April 6, 2015, while
   paying the newspaper’s bills at the post office, and his whereabouts
   are unknown. There has been no verified claim of responsibility, and
   the Houthis have denied responsibility, but the kidnapping happened in
   Sanaa, where the Houthis exercise control.

   Instead of investigating al-Sufi’s disappearance, the Houthis have
   continued to obstruct and detain journalists. For example, on December
   2, they seized the TV channel Yemen Today’s office and held dozens of
   employees hostage until December 13. Many journalists have fled for
   areas under the control of the government in Aden. Under Houthi
   control, the environment is a combination of the hollow shell of
   Saleh’s authoritarian rule of law with the rebel rule of the gun.
   Silence or exile are the only options.

   CHIANG MAI, Thailand
   “In medias res,” the Latin phrase meaning “in the middle of the
   action,” is usually used in a literary context, but sometimes I feel it
   describes the experience of a journalist in exile. It has been 18 years
   since I founded The Irrawaddy, a news publication (and now multifaceted
   news service) based in Chiang Mai. That’s a long time, but the end of
   our journey—our eventual return to a democratic Burma—is still nowhere
   in sight.

   Since we don’t know how far we are from reaching our goal—which is not
   really the end, but actually just the beginning of our real work of
   restoring press freedom in Burma—we feel stuck somewhere in the middle.
   And so we throw ourselves into the day-to-day routine of running a
   media organization, all the while wondering when we will be able to
   practice our trade on our own home soil.

   In some ways, being a journalist in exile means being not in the middle
   of the action, but far from it. These days, however, it is possible to
   keep your ear close to the ground in one country while keeping your
   feet firmly planted in another. Through our network of sources and
   undercover reporters inside Burma, and greatly aided by the latest
   technology, we manage to dig a little more dirt every day—like
   prisoners tunneling our way to a truth the authorities want to prevent
   us from reaching.

   It’s laborious work, but the reward is in knowing that every inch we
   move forward makes a difference. Sometimes, though, it’s difficult to
   know how much of a difference we make. That’s why I often wonder what
   measure of success we can apply to our work.

   By the conventional standards of a modern media organization, we’re not
   doing too badly. We can point to our growing range of products—from our
   original magazine (now a quarterly e-magazine with a limited print run)
   to our well-trafficked Burmese- and English-language websites, from our
   blog and podcast to our television and radio programs broadcast by the
   Democratic Voice of Burma and Radio Free Asia—as evidence of our
   continued relevance.

   We can also look at the numbers: Our websites attract visitors from
   around the world and increasingly from cyber-savvy viewers inside
   Burma, where proxy servers bypass government efforts to block
   “undesirable” content. Between them, our Burmese and English websites
   receive eight or nine million visits annually, with our Burmese site
   showing especially strong growth.

   The feedback we receive every day from our readers suggests that we are
   satisfying a demand. Our weekly television show broadcast via DVB has
   won wide recognition. These days, most people I meet from inside Burma
   tell me they’ve seen and appreciate our program.

   It would be nice to say that we’ve helped in some way to improve the
   media environment inside Burma. But our only contribution in that
   regard has been to provide an outlet for colleagues working within the
   country’s draconian censorship system who want to share stories that
   they can’t report in the domestic press. Otherwise, the situation of
   journalists in Burma remains as grim as ever, even under the current
   “civilian” regime.

   Much has been made of the supposed “opening” of the Burmese media since
   last year’s election. The fact that pictures of pro-democracy leader
   Aung San Suu Kyi, who was released from more than seven years of house
   arrest a week after the November 7 polls, were allowed to appear in
   print has been seen by some as a sign of positive change. But I have my
   doubts.

   There are other issues that remain very much taboo to Burma’s rulers.
   In the country’s border regions, human rights violations remain rife in
   conflict zones. No local publication would dare hint of the rape,
   murder, and forced relocation that are part of the army’s campaign to
   impose its will on ethnic minorities. The brutal suppression of hunger
   strikes by political prisoners is another subject that will never
   appear in the Burmese press. Forced labor, child soldiers in the
   Burmese army, and massive deforestation by cronies of the ruling
   generals are also among the many unmentionables.

   Even the impact of mega-projects that will transform Burma’s landscape
   forever, affecting potentially millions of its citizens, cannot be
   discussed within the pages of the country’s newspapers. Dams in the
   Kachin, Shan, and Karen states are being built to produce energy for
   Burma’s neighbors, while its citizens continue to live with brownouts.
   In Arakan state, a gas pipeline for China will enrich the generals but
   do nothing for local people.

   There has been much speculation that Thein Sein, the ex-general and
   former prime minister who now ostensibly leads the country as its
   president, will start holding regular press conferences. So far,
   however, he remains as remote from the independent press as his
   predecessors, who were never very interested in answering questions
   from anybody.

   This lack of real progress inside Burma—on the issue of media freedom,
   or on any other front—hasn’t prevented some from declaring this a
   turning point in the country’s transition to democracy. This has put
   new pressure on the exile media: As some governments move toward more
   active engagement with Naypyidaw, donors that have long supported our
   work also seem inclined to shift their attention toward the
   possibilities, however illusory, of effecting change from within the
   country.

   Does this mean we are losing our allies, the foundations and government
   agencies that share our commitment to press freedom in Burma? Probably
   not, but our dependence on their support has never seemed more
   precarious. And in some cases—in which former supporters have attacked
   us for our activities, presumably to curry favor with a regime they see
   as a viable “partner”—we have been forced to ask ourselves who our real
   friends are.

   Meanwhile, we have no doubt who the enemy is—anyone who stands in the
   way of telling the stories that need to be told. Even when we are being
   attacked by hackers and other cyber-phantoms, as we recently were, we
   keep our eyes on what is really happening in Burma and try not to get
   sidetracked by distractions. If anything, we take these attempts to
   derail our efforts as a sign that we’re on the right track.

   Despite the challenges that face us on a daily basis, and the
   uncertainties that have always hung over us, we know the only way
   forward is to keep working every day. Eventually, Burma will have that
   breakthrough moment when everything changes, for real and forever. And
   when that day comes, we’ll be ready for it.

For Turkish journalists in Berlin exile, threats remain, but in different
forms

   For Can Dündar, sitting in the audience of a theater performance near
   Dortmund in Germany in May was an emotional moment. In an interview
   with CPJ, he recalled how during the premiere night, he watched the
   main actor on stage playing a journalist as he was imprisoned in
   Turkey, had his house searched, his books banned, and then had to leave
   the country and start a new life in exile in Berlin, leaving behind his
   wife, whose passport was confiscated by the authorities. The journalist
   on the stage was Dündar himself, and the dramatic events unfolding were
   his own life, as the performance was based on his autobiographical
   book, “Traitor,” published in Germany in 2017.

   In one scene, the main character starts a conversation with his police
   security detail in Germany, telling the man charged with protecting him
   from attack how he misses his dog, left behind in Turkey. “The
   policeman I had the conversation with in real life was sitting next to
   me, and we both realized how close we got,” Dündar said.

   The moment Dündar described was symbolic: getting close to a police
   officer and sharing an emotional moment was unimaginable in Turkey,
   where police are a constant source of fear. It demonstrated how much
   life in exile is different from the one left behind in Turkey, but at
   the same time highlighted the persistence of threats. I spoke with
   Dündar and two other Turkish journalists living in Berlin about their
   work and life in exile and the dangers they face in their new
   environment.

   “One big difference is how the blue light and sounds of the police cars
   in the street during the night do not worry me any longer,” Hayko
   Bağdat told me. He left Turkey with his family and settled in Berlin in
   2017 after being threatened and investigated by Turkish authorities
   because of his reporting, especially after the attempted coup against
   President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in July 2016. “On coming to Germany, I
   could finally sleep normally during the nights,” Bağdat said.

   Zübeyde Sari, a relative newcomer to Berlin having arrived in December
   2018, told me how much relief it was for her not to have to deal with
   authorities because of her reporting. “I only have to meet authorities
   when I do my paperwork concerning my stay here,” she said.
   Hayko Bağdat, a Turkish journalist in exile in Berlin, moves around
   with so many police officers that 'people might think I am Brad Pitt.'

   Brad Pitt.’ (Hayko Bağdat)

   While all three journalists expressed relief over not having to
   continuously fear Turkish authorities, other risks remain. “Threats are
   my destiny,” Bağdat said sarcastically, noting the number of daily
   threats he receives on social media has not changed since he moved to
   Germany. “I get hundreds of harassing social media messages daily, some
   of them clear threats and sometimes direct death threats too,” Bağdat
   said.

   In Turkey, Bağdat had a talk show on national broadcaster IMC TV, wrote
   columns for the now-banned Turkish investigative daily Taraf, the
   Armenian weekly Marmara and the news website Diken. He is active on
   social media with more than a million Twitter followers. “I am a hate
   subject first because I am Armenian and second because of the criticism
   I have toward the Turkish government,” he said.

   Dündar, the former editor-in-chief of Cumhuriyet newspaper and a
   recipient of CPJ’s 2016 International Press Freedom Award, is one of
   the most prominent Turkish journalists in exile. He had to leave his
   country in June 2016 after he was continuously harassed by authorities
   and sentenced to prison on charges of revealing state secrets for a
   report alleging that Turkey had tried to ship arms to Islamists in
   Syria. “I have an arrest warrant against me in Turkey,” he said.

   For Dündar, threats are not always virtual. His face is well known
   across Turkey and among the Turkish community in Germany where, a 2018
   study found, the roughly 3 million people with Turkish roots feel more
   strongly connected to Turkey than to Germany, and around two-thirds of
   them support Erdoğan. In Berlin, Dündar founded and manages a nonprofit
   online radio station and newsletter called Özgürüz (“We are free”),
   banned in Turkey, as well as writing regular columns in German
   newspapers and publishing books. “I get regular insults in the street
   from ordinary people, taxi drivers who are often Turks in Berlin call
   me traitor, people sometimes take photos and videos of me walking in
   the street and put them online,” Dündar said. On one occasion, a
   Turkish TV crew showed up at the door of his office, filmed him, and
   put the address on the internet. Dündar said he thinks more and more of
   moving to London where the Turkish community is more diverse and he
   might be less exposed to such harassment.

   “When I meet someone here, it is difficult to speak about Turkey as
   they sympathize with the Erdoğan government but I know that they are
   far from the Turkish reality, they just get their information from the
   propaganda,” said Zübeyde Sari, who is a reporter and producer at
   Dündar’s Özgürüz radio. She feels hostility from the local Turkish
   community toward new emigres, and is harassed on her social media
   accounts. Prior to coming Germany, she worked as a reporter at IMC TV
   and earlier with BBC Türkçe, where her coverage included opposition
   movements and protests.

   Both Dündar and Bağdat live under some kind of police protection
   because of various risks, from the Turkish intelligence agency’s widely
   reported practice of kidnapping dissidents (or trying to) and bringing
   them home to possible physical attacks and even death threats. They
   told me that German authorities continuously assess the risks for
   whether 24-hour protection is needed or some lower level security can
   be applied. Although they are free to exercise their journalism, the
   tight security makes it difficult to report.

   “There are periods when German police think the danger is so great that
   I have to be accompanied by security details everywhere I go,” Dündar
   said. That was especially the case in 2018, when president Erdoğan
   visited Berlin and called on the German authorities to extradite him,
   and threatened to cancel the joint press conference with Chancellor
   Angela Merkel if he would also be present. To solve the diplomatic
   gridlock which put his German hosts in an uncomfortable situation,
   Dündar decided not to attend the press conference. “Once you are
   publicly pinpointed by Erdoğan, the threat level is raised,” he told
   CPJ.

   “People might think that I am Brad Pitt or some kind of VIP, I have
   sometimes so many policemen accompanying me, especially when I go to
   any public event,” said Bağdat, who has performed one-man theatrical
   shows, always amid tight security, sometimes wearing a bulletproof
   vest. “I am trying to find home jobs to make a living in Berlin, as for
   me leaving home for work is almost impossible,” he said.

   For Dündar, traveling outside Germany is also a challenge as he cannot
   be sure whether Turkey’s international arrest will be eventually
   enforced by one of the countries he visits. In one strongly positive
   development, though, he was reunited with his wife in June after three
   years of separation as she managed to escape from Turkey, where
   authorities had confiscated her passport.

   The separation had added an extra level of symbolism to the stage
   design of the play based on his life. “It was a golden cage and when
   the woman held hostage in Turkey reproaches the man in the cage for not
   being able to see her son, also living outside Turkey, because of him
   for years, I heard sobs all around,” Dündar said.

   On June 24, a grenade was thrown through the window of Voice of America
   correspondent Diane Nininahazwe’s home. It was one of three cases CPJ
   has documented in recent months where grenades were thrown into the
   homes of journalists in Burundi’s capital, Bujumbura. Fortunately,
   there have been no fatalities, but there have also been no arrests.

   The attack at Nininahazwe’s house happened the day after she received
   threatening text messages. Nininahazwe had just returned from Gihanga,
   north of Bujumbura, where she had been reporting on abductions. She
   told CPJ she was too frightened to report the incident to police and
   has been in hiding ever since.

   Since April 26, when Burundians took to the streets to protest
   President Pierre Nkurunziza’s unconstitutional bid for a third term,
   CPJ has documented a series of attacks on journalists. The crackdown
   intensified after an attempted military coup on May 13. Media outlets
   and radio stations were attacked and in some cases burned to the
   ground, and many of the journalists employed at them have been harassed
   and threatened, according to reports and journalists with whom CPJ
   spoke.

   On August 20, despite a disputed election, Nkurunziza was quietly sworn
   in for a third term. No foreign head of state attended the
   inauguration. The recent closure of the country’s four leading
   privately owned radio stations, which have all been attacked or ordered
   by authorities to stop broadcasting, meant fewer journalists were there
   to witness the event too. The attacks on these stations and journalists
   has induced an exodus, leaving coverage sparse during a sensitive
   period.

   Estimates from the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees
   suggest about 180,000 civilians have fled Burundi since the protests
   began, with the majority traveling to neighboring Rwanda. CPJ and the
   Burundi Union of Journalists are aware of at least 100 journalists who
   have left the country since April. The journalists who left said they
   had been threatened, or feared persecution and a lack of employment
   after stations were shut down by authorities or set on fire during
   protests.

   An exiled journalist who used to work for Renaissance Radio and
   Television told CPJ the station had come under pressure from the
   government during protests in April to report favorably or be closed
   down. The journalist, who asked not to be named, said that the pressure
   increased after the station covered the coup.

   Before the threats of closure could be acted on, the privately owned
   station was burned down during clashes and unrest in the city on May
   14.

   Another journalist, who asked not to be named and who worked for
   Bonesha FM before the independent station was set alight during unrest
   around the same time as Renaissance Radio, said: “We were routinely
   intimidated during the unrest on the street by the ruling party youth
   militia, the Imbonerakure. They would check your laptop, your phone,
   even any social media accounts you have–as if they had any legal
   authority to do so.” The journalist, who hid in a truck carrying sacks
   of tea and whose two children managed to join him in exile, added:
   “Police just sit idly by and let these armed youth do as they please,
   the situation was so precarious, you never know what might happen.”

   Calls by CPJ to the Bujumbura police and a government spokesman to ask
   for a response to the claims made by the journalists were not answered.

   The Renaissance Radio and Television journalist, who managed to escape
   the country with his wife and children on what he described as a
   harrowing bus ride, said: “The worst part is trying to explain this
   senseless situation to our children, I am often lost for words.”

   Life in exile is far from easy. Compared to Burundi, Rwanda can be
   expensive, and many journalists fled with few possessions or prospects
   for work. The majority have their families with them, a journalist
   still in Burundi and who asked to remain anonymous because of security
   fears, told CPJ. Relatives who stayed behind have been forced into
   hiding for fear of retributive violence. Former senior journalists in
   exile have found themselves sharing cramped rooms, surviving on one
   meal per day, said Bonesha FM Director Patrick Nduwimana. The support
   organization Rwanda Journalists Association has helped some of those in
   exile by providing a guesthouse and space for the journalists to work,
   the association’s executive secretary, Gonzaga Muganwa, said.

   So many journalists have left that only the state broadcaster and a
   handful of faith-based radio stations that do not cover news are still
   in operation, according to local journalists. “The Burundi press used
   to be openly critical of the government,” Muganwa said. “Now there are
   no Burundians on the ground to capture the story fully–it’s an
   advantage for the [government].”

   Nduwimana, who also acts as the head of an association of independent
   Burundi broadcasters, agreed. “There is now a blackout, for instance,
   on human rights violations that were previously made public by
   Burundi’s independent press,” Nduwimana told CPJ. “Every day people are
   kidnapped and killed,” he said, referring to claims of abductions and
   attacks reported by Amnesty International and international news
   outlets. Nduwimana highlighted how, without an independent press to
   report on such issues, future human rights violations could go
   undocumented.

   Those still reporting in the country must be extremely careful,
   according to Innocent Muhozi, the director of Renaissance Radio and
   Television and independent media support organization, the Burundian
   Press Observatory. Muhozi who decided to remain in Bujumbura, was
   quoted in a news report saying that he can no longer assign staff to
   cover certain places because of the dangers. A journalist with the
   state broadcaster, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, added that
   “journalists who are working, especially journalists at state
   broadcaster Burundi National Radio and Television (RTNB) are not
   trusted by the public and consequently are targeted by police for one
   side, protesters and the public on the other side.” The journalist said
   the scope of what can be safely covered is limited. Alleged killings
   cannot be investigated without fear that the journalist will be next,
   the reporter told CPJ.

   Before the crackdown, people in Bujumbura routinely listened to the
   radio through their phones, tuning in daily around noon for the news,
   the Renaissance Radio and Television journalist, who asked not to be
   named, said. But without access to independent broadcasters, the public
   will be “stuck relying on rumors rather than impartial information,”
   Nduwimana, of Bonesha FM, said. He is involved in a project with some
   of the journalists living in exile, who launched an online radio
   station named Nzamba, which refers to a traditional trumpet. It
   broadcasts a daily news program focused on Burundi.

   Although its impact may appear negligible–Burundi has the lowest
   Internet penetration in East Africa with only 1.38 percent individual
   usage in 2014, according to the International Telecommunication Union
   statistics–Burundians who do have access to the Internet share
   information with others through a variety of means. Audio files are
   disseminated to smart phones though apps such as What’sApp, according
   to Nduwimana.

   Although there were mixed views from the journalists with whom CPJ
   spoke on whether the situation in Burundi will improve any time soon,
   they agreed that access to independent news would help. One journalist,
   who did not wish to be identified, told CPJ: “This has been caused by
   the political crisis, so it will be improved if the government shows
   the will to reopen or give more space [to] private media. To be
   operational, journalists must be seen as contributors not destroyers.”

   After several years of painful, bewildering, infuriating exile, climate
   policy is back on the agenda. Thank god.

   Something pretty remarkable has happened in the last month, and I don’t
   think many people have noticed. After several years in which climate
   policy was sidelined from beltway political discussion, after a
   presidential campaign in which the issue was almost entirely ignored,
   it’s clawing its way back into the conversation. You can feel the
   terrain shifting beneath our feet subtly but unmistakably.

   First there was Sandy, a devastating, 100-year storm that hit the
   nation’s media capital, highlighted just how much damage higher sea
   levels can do, and caused an estimated $50 billion in damages. The
   elephant in the room–the fact that storm intensity will likely grow in
   the future, and combine with higher sea levels to do even more
   damage–did not go unnoticed by politicians.

   Then came news that 2012 was the warmest year in the United States ever
   recorded, and not by a little bit. By a full degree Fahrenheit. And
   then, suddenly, after saying hardly a word about the climate for much
   of the last year, the president himself, to his great credit, has
   pushed it back onto the agenda. In his inaugural address he surprised
   observers by saying this early in the speech, as the first domestic
   policy issue he mentioned after dealing with the economy:

     “We will respond to the threat of climate change, knowing that the
     failure to do so would betray our children and future generations.
     Some may still deny the overwhelming judgment of science, but none
     can avoid the devastating impact of raging fires, and crippling
     drought, and more powerful storms.”

   During Tuesday night’s State of the Union speech, the president once
   again foregrounded climate, putting it as the first domestic policy
   issue after the economy and was even more emphatic in his promises to
   act, saying, ”I urge this Congress to pursue a bipartisan, market-based
   solution to climate change, like the one John McCain and Joe Lieberman
   worked on together a few years ago. But if Congress won’t act soon to
   protect future generations, I will.”

   Then on Thursday, the independent congressional watchdog the Government
   Accountability Office came out with a new report identifying risks to
   the government and at the top of the list was the the fiscal exposure
   the federal government faces due to Climate Change. Remarkably, Darrell
   Issa, the Republican Chairman of the House Oversight and Government
   Reform Committee–he of the Fast and Furious scandalmongering, bete noir
   of liberals–had this to say about the GAO report:

     “I don’t want to walk away from anything in this report…when you
     look climate change and Hurricane Sandy, and others, it points out
     that we have under-prepared through FEMA, and through our emergency
     funds including flood control for a generation.”

   Finally this week, Sens. Bernie Sanders and Barbara Boxer introduced a
   new, ambitious climate bill that, in the admittedly unlikely event it
   is passed, would represent a major victory for climate activists with
   its $20 tax on each ton of carbon pollution as well as its enabling the
   Environmental Protection Agency to regulate fracking.

   After several years of painful, bewildering, infuriating exile, climate
   policy is back on the agenda. Thank god.

   Now, I don’t want to minimize just how far things still have to go and
   how many challenges there are to overcome to make the kinds of changes
   required to reduce the risk of total disaster. We were reminded once
   again this week of the lengths the wealthiest industry in the country,
   the fossil fuel companies who have trillions of dollars on the line,
   will go to preserve their right to dump their pollution cost free.

   This week the Guardian newspaper reported the conservative dark money
   group Donors Trust funneled almost $120 million between 2002 to 2010 to
   groups denying the science on climate change. And that’s on top of the
   sizable funding from Koch Industries, Exxon and others towards
   denialist groups. That funding and the pro-pollution lobbying
   infrastructure aren’t going anywhere.

   There’s also the president himself who, while admirably talking about
   the issue, has yet to indicate whether or not he will use his authority
   to block the wildly destructive Keystone Pipeline, and who after his
   strong words in the State of Union, didn’t indicate in his follow-up
   Google Plus Fireside Hangout that the administration would break any
   new ground in executive action:

     “The same steps that we took with respect to energy efficiency on
     cars, we can take on buildings, we can take on appliances, we can
     make sure that new power plants that are being built are more
     efficient than old ones, and we can continue to put research and our
     support behind clean energy that is going to continue to help us
     transition away from dirtier fuels.”

   And then, perhaps most pernicious at this moment, is the strange
   culture of Washington that views climate as a niche, special interest
   issue relevant only to environmental groups and not every living human
   on the planet. While pundits, strategists, columnists
   and politicians absolutely obsess over budget projections for the year
   2040, those same strategists, columnists and politicians seem
   remarkably sanguine about the fact that Arctic ice volume has shrunk by
   more than a third in the last decade and more and more recent data that
   indicate our previous climate models have underestimated the terrifying
   rate of change to our climate and overestimated just how much time we
   have left to get our collective asses in gear.

   No one will care in 30 years what the deficit was in 2013. I guarantee
   you. Quick pop quiz: what was the deficit in 1953? or 1923? or, heck
   1883? The right answer is: you don’t know because it doesn’t
   matter. What does matter are the molecules in the air, much much more
   than numbers on a balance sheet.

   And I’m sorry to say the strange apathy about the climate extends past
   the usual suspects of deficit-obsessives to people that broadly
   constitute the president’s base. It’s a standard liberal trope of
   activists to whine that fellow liberals aren’t paying enough attention
   to the issue they care most about, but at the risk of falling into it,
   I can’t help but notice that even when the president tries to insert
   climate into the conversation it tends to fall with a dull thud among
   the bulk of progressive politicians, activists, and media outlets.

   Washington will never make climate a priority until the left makes it a
   priority.

We need to adequately plan for internal migration due to climate change

   At the height of the Syrian and Rohingya crises, much of the world’s
   attention turned to forced displacement and refugees. Both exemplified
   the typical conditions under which people are forcibly displaced: war,
   political persecution, economic instability and repression. Still, most
   of the world’s migration is internal, i.e. within the same country.
   Among the tens of millions displaced in 2015, 21.3 million were
   refugees, but 40.8 million were internally displaced. People usually
   change their homes to improve household income, for marriage or other
   purposes relating to family.

   With climate change, however, its worsening slow onset effects such as
   droughts, effects from sea level rise and water shortages will cause
   many more to leave their homes and move to safer places. Such migration
   may be a choice in the initial stages; for instance, a young member may
   travel to a city close by during a drought to increase his or her
   family’s income. But as the stress becomes more severe, the decision to
   move may be forced. The gradual rise in sea levels wherein people are
   compelled to leave their island nations in the Pacific and Indian
   Oceans and become climate exiles is one such ongoing process that will
   likely increase out-migration over time

   Why people move

   In “Groundswell: Preparing for Internal Climate Migration”, a recent
   report by the World Bank, it is estimated that in Latin America, South
   Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa over 143 million people would be forced to
   move within borders by 2050 as a result of slow onset climate events
   alone. In the worst-case scenario, about 40 million of these migrants
   would be in South Asia, which is the most populous of the regions
   studied, with a number of climate change effects anticipated.

   The report examines countries in East Africa, South Asia and Central
   America more closely. Here, it dives deep into the conditions in
   Ethiopia, Bangladesh and Mexico. Three possible scenarios are
   described: high greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions along with unequal
   development paths, regarded as the pessimistic reference scenario; an
   inclusive development scenario with high GHG emissions but development
   paths that improve access to services for the poor and consider their
   priorities and unmet needs; and a climate-friendly scenario involving
   lower GHG emissions but with unequal development.

   South Asia is characterised by rain-fed farmland in large parts of the
   region. With variability in the monsoons and warmer temperatures, crop
   failures will lead to migration from the Gangetic plains and from the
   rice-growing northeast of Bangladesh and the inundated coasts. In the
   pessimistic scenario, the numbers forced to move internally in South
   Asia are expected to increase six-fold between 2020 and 2050 and will
   continue to rise beyond 2050 without appropriate climate action. Even
   in the inclusive development and climate-friendly scenarios, tens of
   millions will be forced to migrate. While people normally gravitate to
   big cities, those along the coast such as Mumbai, Chennai, Chittagong
   and Dhaka will themselves be vulnerable to storm surges and other
   effects from sea level rise.

   The poor would be the worst affected by these slow onset events and
   most of them would migrate out of rural areas to nearby urban
   settlements, which would be cities and the peri-urban surroundings.
   Such “hotspots” of in and out migration would be stressed for natural
   resources, public services and livelihoods. In India, areas between
   Chennai and Bengaluru have been highlighted in the report along with
   those around Mexico City, Guatemala City and Nairobi. In India, there
   are already signs of unplanned and frontier-led growth in peri-urban
   areas. Past experience shows that planning that ignores the ecosystem
   services provided by local natural resources such as water tanks and
   forested areas generates further problems particularly for the poorest
   and most vulnerable.

   The implications of these internal migrations will be significant for
   development in the areas and for the lives of these people. Therefore,
   understanding migration patterns, getting better socioeconomic data on
   migration and preparing in advance through appropriate planning become
   critical. The scenarios used in the Bank report could be extended to
   cover other time periods and could also be more localised. Current
   climate modelling methods are not accurate at high resolutions for
   local decision-making, but these are expected to improve over time.

   What can be done?

   What kind of policies are needed? Reducing GHG emissions is of utmost
   urgency, although that seems to be taking place at a pace determined by
   geopolitical as well as local initiatives. Second, integrating internal
   migration with ongoing development planning is vital. The peri-urban
   areas, which are expected to be hot spots, already show problems of
   water shortage, waste management, nutritional deficiency, limited
   services such as health and education, and poor infrastructure.
   Ecosystems, part of the natural resources in peri-urban areas, ought to
   be protected as “special ecological zones”, so that as urban
   settlements expand, they don’t eat into ecosystem services. Skill
   building, job training and other opportunities for education and jobs
   for locals and migrants would also have to become a focal point. Rights
   for those who are forced to migrate would be fundamental in these
   preparations, as studies and experience have shown that ignoring issues
   of social justice and equity in adaptation can lead to serious
   governance failure.

   Moscow’s chief rabbi, Pinchas Goldschmidt, is “in exile” after
   resisting Kremlin pressure to support the war in Ukraine, his
   daughter-in-law has said.

   Goldschmidt, who also heads the Conference of European Rabbis, left
   Russia just weeks after it launched its invasion of Ukraine, saying he
   had to take care of his ailing father in Jerusalem.

   But this week his daughter-in-law revealed that Goldschmidt and his
   wife had also been put under official pressure to support the war and
   now considered themselves to be in exile because of their opposition to
   what Russia has called its “special military operation”.

   “Can finally share that my in-laws, Moscow chief rabbi [Pinchas
   Goldschmidt] &amp; Rebbetzin Dara Goldschmidt, have been put under pressure
   by authorities to publicly support the ‘special operation’ in Ukraine –
   and refused,” Avital Chizhik-Goldschmidt, a journalist who is married
   to Goldschmidt’s son, Benjamin, wrote on Twitter on Tuesday evening.

     Can finally share that my in-laws, Moscow Chief Rabbi @PinchasRabbi
     &amp; Rebbetzin Dara Goldschmidt, have been put under pressure by

   Goldschmidt has been Moscow’s chief rabbi since 1993 and is one of the
   most influential Jewish leaders in Russia. If the account is confirmed,
   Goldschmidt would be a rare high-profile religious leader to leave
   Russia due to opposition to the war. The Orthodox bishop, Patriarch
   Kirill, and other religious leaders in Russia have voiced support of
   the war.

   The Guardian has written to Goldschmidt and Chizhik-Goldschmidt for
   comment.

   “They are now in exile from the community they loved, built and raised
   their children in over 33 years,” Chizhik-Goldschmidt wrote, describing
   a journey that took her parents-in-law through Hungary and then eastern
   Europe, where she said they had helped fundraising efforts for
   Ukrainian refugees.

   He went on to Jerusalem, where his father had been in hospital.

   “The pain &amp; fear in our family the last few months is beyond words,”
   she said. “The sounds of the Moscow Choral Synagogue ring in our ears …
   I’ll never forget our engagement there in ‘14, &amp; taking our children
   there, Shavuos ‘18… Grateful our parents are safe; worried sick over
   many others …”

   Demographers estimate there are about 150,000 Jewish people in Russia.

   Goldschmidt was reelected on Tuesday to another seven-year term as the
   chief rabbi of Moscow and the leader of the Moscow Choral Synagogue,
   one of Russia’s most storied houses of worship. He had remained in his
   post while outside the country, delegating authority to a deputy in his
   absence.

   His reelection was supported by a number of senior Israeli rabbis, who
   had asked that “no change be made in the composition of the rabbinate
   and the tribunal without coordination with us”. Another conservative
   religious leader in Israel warned that “we have been witnessing a
   difficult reality when governments try to interfere in the tenure of
   rabbis”.

   There were also reports of government pressure to replace Goldschmidt
   in the elections. “The coup attempt failed,” a source in the Russian
   Jewish community told the Jerusalem Post.

   Goldschmidt had previously told Israel’s Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper
   that he did “not define myself as an exiled rabbi, I am a rabbi who is
   not living in his community”.

   But at an opening ceremony for the Conference of European Rabbis in
   Munich last week, Goldschmidt was accompanied by several German
   bodyguards while he delivered a speech attacking the war.

   “We have to pray for peace and for the end of this terrible war,” he
   said. “We have to pray that this war will end soon and not escalate
   into a nuclear conflict that can destroy humanity.”

   Taha Siddiqui is an award-winning Pakistani journalist. He has been
   living in exile in Paris since he survived a kidnapping and possible
   assassination attempt two years ago. He still highlights under-reported
   stories from Pakistan in the international press and advocates for
   freedom of expression in the media through his initiative, South Asia
   Press. Earlier this year, Siddiqui and his wife, Sara Farid, launched
   the Dissident Club, a bar and café in Paris that brings dissidents of
   the world together for discussion, debate and support. Here we find out
   more about Siddiqui’s testing journey, how safe he feels in exile and
   what keeps him going, despite the dangers of his profession.
     __________________________________________________________________

All of your initiatives seem to stem from your journalistic work. What drew
you to journalism as a profession?

   I don’t actually have any journalism qualifications to begin with. I
   got into journalism through a degree in finance. My first job was with
   CNBC Pakistan as a financial analyst. A year later, in 2007, I started
   working for Geo TV, one of the main channels in Pakistan. I reported on
   business and the stock market. But this was a very turbulent time for
   Pakistan; we were in the final stages of the military dictatorship of
   General Musharraf. One day, I realised that business reporting is just
   one niche of journalism, and that it can’t be seen in isolation from
   politics and society. I decided to switch from economic reporting to
   political economic reporting, and then to reporting on social issues
   and human rights.

What did you expect working as a journalist in Pakistan would be like, and
how was it different?

     “Instead of being in a corporate bubble, I got to really explore my
     country through journalism.”

   After a few years of mainstream reporting, I realised there was a lot
   of self-censorship in the Pakistani media world. There was a lot of
   control and taboo around topics such as religion and the military. We
   say journalists aren’t there to create change, but I think we are. We
   advocate for change in our own way; our reporting may not say “change
   this”, but by showing what is happening, we do subliminally convey
   where change is needed. But working with local [Pakistani] media didn’t
   allow me to do something truly worthwhile with journalism. I couldn’t
   have the independence I wanted.

   This is when I started working with international media, first as a
   freelancer, and eventually as a reporter for France24. It was my first
   foray into writing, but it turned out that I write well, and I started
   writing stories for publications like The New York Times and The
   Guardian. I never looked back. Instead of being in a corporate bubble,
   I got to really explore my country through journalism.

You grew up in Saudi Arabia, but have focused on Pakistan and South Asia in
your work. Was it difficult, at first, to write critically about a country
that is yours but that you didn’t grow up in?

     “I could question things people weren’t questioning because they had
     lived with it comfortably throughout their lives.”

   I did grow up in Saudi Arabia, and came to Pakistan at 16. In some
   ways, this was actually lucky. I came into Pakistan with a clean slate,
   a blank page. Pakistani schools brainwash you to believe in Pakistan,
   the Islamic Republic and false histories. I didn’t go through the mass
   production that happens in Pakistan through education. When I started
   looking at things from an international perspective, which working with
   foreign media thankfully gave me the space to do, I began to understand
   Pakistan from another fresh perspective. I could question things people
   weren’t questioning because they had lived with it comfortably
   throughout their lives. I had an advantage rather than a disadvantage.

In 2018, you went into exile in France. Can you describe the events that led
you to leave Pakistan with your wife and then five-year-old son?

     “The idea was to come to Paris for a little while, wait for things
     back home to calm down and go back. I soon realised I may not be
     able to go back.”

   My newfound liberty was short-lived because on January 10, 2018, I was
   attacked. I was on my way to the airport in Islamabad when my taxi was
   stopped by armed men. They kidnapped me and made a possible
   assassination attempt on my life. I believe them to be from the
   Pakistan military, because they had been threatening me for a number of
   years because of my journalistic work.

   I escaped, but realised that if I wanted to continue speaking up, I
   couldn’t do so in Pakistan any longer. I came to France because of the
   strong media connections and friendships I already had here. The idea
   was to come to Paris for a little while, wait for things back home to
   calm down and go back. I soon realised I may not be able to go back.
   Partly because I do feel much freer here, but also because I was
   informed that there is an assassination plot against me in Pakistan. I
   knew then that I’d be here long term.

As your journalism work evolved to become more critical of the regime in
Pakistan, did you have an awareness of the risks involved?

     ‘There was a running joke among my friends in Islamabad. They’d say
     things like, “Let’s take a selfie with Taha, because it might be the
     last.”‘

   Oh, yes. Pakistan has existed for almost 70 years, and it has been
   under either direct or indirect military rule for all that time. When I
   started being critical, senior journalists would indirectly tell me to
   be careful. Then the military started telling me directly that I was
   crossing a line. They would invite me over for a cup of tea and give me
   friendly reminders to be careful, but these were really warnings, of
   course. There was a running joke among my friends in Islamabad. They’d
   say things like, “Let’s take a selfie with Taha, because it might be
   the last.” Everyone knew I was on the military’s list and could be the
   next one.

What drove you to keep going despite these very real dangers?

     “If none of us speak up, things just get worse. And because a lot of
     us were not speaking up, I had to do so even louder.”

   I continued to do what I did because I felt that someone should.
   Journalism as a field was under attack, and I felt that simply going
   out and reporting wasn’t enough—I had to fight back. If none of us
   speak up, things just get worse. And because a lot of us were not
   speaking up, I had to do so even louder. I had to compensate. So I was
   actually going out of my way to do it.

   image

You still work actively with the French and international media today. Since
coming to Paris, how has the nature of your profession changed?

   Now, I mostly focus on writing analyses about Pakistan based on what
   we’re already seeing reported. At the same time, because of my 15 years
   as a reporter in Pakistan, I developed strong connections with people
   on the ground. Technology helps a lot to stay connected; people tag and
   inform me online when there are important stories they want to talk
   about. Since I’ve gone into exile, I actually feel like a lot of people
   reach out to me more, because back home, they can’t talk about their
   problems. So they reach out and tell me that I should be the one to
   talk about it, because I have the safety of exile.

Do you feel safe in exile?

     “…my father was actually interrogated by the military intelligence
     in Pakistan earlier this year. We didn’t know if he was going to
     come back or not.”

   I do feel safer here than in Pakistan, but I wouldn’t say I’m safe.
   People in exile also get attacked, it’s happening a lot more in Europe.
   Just recently, an exiled Pakistani journalist was found dead in Sweden.
   And I know the Pakistani state is still keeping an eye on me. Someone
   from the Pakistan embassy came to do surveillance at an event at the
   Dissident Club just a few weeks ago. The military contacts me directly
   sometimes, asking why I do what I do, telling me to stop.

   I also need to think of my family back home. My parents get harassed a
   lot; my father was actually interrogated by the military intelligence
   in Pakistan earlier this year. We didn’t know if he was going to come
   back or not. He ended up denouncing and disowning me as a way to keep
   the family safe.

How do you find a balance between staying safe and having a job with inherent
public visibility?

     “Right now I’m threatened by the state, but I almost see that as a
     confirmation of relevance.”

   Even in exile, I am strategic about my journalism. I don’t always say
   everything I’d like to say, especially on a subject like religion. I’m
   an atheist and find the role of Islam in Pakistan very problematic, but
   I don’t talk about that on social media or in my writing, because I
   know that will bring another set of threats. Right now I’m threatened
   by the state, but I almost see that as a confirmation of relevance. I
   continue to haunt them, and that’s exactly what I want. But if I go
   down certain paths, like criticising Islam, non-state actors will start
   to pose a threat, too, and I try to avoid that.

Can you tell us more about the Dissident Club and what led you to start it?

   When I realised I’d be here long term, I started looking for something
   to do in France. I wanted to do something that was an extension of what
   I was already doing in life: activism, journalism, advocacy. All of
   that combined to give birth to the Dissident Club, which I founded with
   my wife, Sara Farid, a photojournalist. At the Dissident Club, we bring
   dissidents from all over the world together. On July 14, for example,
   we held a conference on how safe Europe is for exiled dissidents. There
   were activists from Russia, China, Iran, Belarus, Turkey, Saudi Arabia…
   These connections help with the fights we all face in our own
   countries, because most authoritarian regimes act in very similar ways,
   in how they crack down on free speech and political opposition. We can
   learn from each other.

   image

How is your work at the Dissident Club different from being a journalist? And
what is the common thread between these two hats you wear?

     “Real journalism connects people with stories, and that’s what the
     Dissident Club is doing as well.”

   At the Dissident Club, we allow people to meet with each other and with
   French society. And that’s sort of what good journalism does, too. It
   tries to bring experiences to people who don’t know about these
   experiences. Real journalism connects people with stories, and that’s
   what the Dissident Club is doing as well.

   The Dissident Club has expanded the scope of my work, now that I’m not
   only focusing on Pakistan or South Asia. That also increases the risk.
   Before, I was just challenging the Pakistan military; now I’m bringing
   in dissidents from everywhere and creating a larger target on my back.
   I think about that sometimes, but I hope I’m protected enough in Paris.
   More so than in Pakistan, anyway.

The timing of the opening was very unfortunate—you opened just before the
March lockdown. What have the impacts of Covid-19 been on the Dissident Club
and how have you been responding to these?

   The idea when we launched in February was to do some renovation work
   with a bank loan, but that did not come through because of the crisis.
   Instead, with help from friends and family, my wife and I put in all
   our equity to have six months of cash flow. We also launched an online
   campaign selling “future drinks” and got another month of cash flow
   through that.

   Still, at some point, we were three months behind on rent. In June, we
   decided that we couldn’t wait for the renovation before reopening.
   Around that time, someone who had read about our financial difficulties
   donated several TV screens, and we started using those to screen
   documentaries. Of course, Covid-19 combined with the summer period
   meant the Club was pretty dead. Things started to pick up in September,
   and we had 10 events planned for October, but had to cancel everything
   when the 9pm curfew was put in place. We now do events on weekends and
   earlier in the day.

   We’re also trying to offer lunch. We recently bought all the equipment
   but still need to develop the menu. Our idea—it’s a cliché, I know—was
   to do “intellectual food”. We never planned on doing “real food” and
   are new to it. But we’re trying and will hopefully be able to serve
   lunch in a few weeks.

   We recently launched a crowdfunding campaign in the hope that it will
   sustain us for the next few months.

What events should we keep an eye out for?

     “Back in Pakistan, I was very pro-Charlie Hebdo, for example. Since
     coming to France, I’ve realised there’s a lot more complexity to
     that debate.”

   We want to organise something on the issue of free speech in France.
   I’m a big advocate of free speech. Back in Pakistan, I was very
   pro-Charlie Hebdo, for example. Since coming to France, I’ve realised
   there’s a lot more complexity to that debate. It is not just about free
   speech, it is also about foreign policy, racism, islamophobia. We need
   to discuss all of that. It can be a controversial subject, especially
   now, so I’m still trying to see what form it should take, but an event
   should happen in the next few weeks. All the information will be
   published on our site, so keep an eye out!

Working and being productive in exile

     Das waren die Emigranten: der Prokurist aus Bielefeld, der dachte,
     er hätte Aussichten auf eine Stellung in einem großen Warenhaus. Da
     war der bekannte Rechtsanwalt aus Berlin, der träumte von einem
     Angebot eines Konzerns. Den berühmten Herzspezialisten erwartete
     eine umfangreiche Praxis. Der Schriftsteller glaubte einen Kontrakt
     in der Tasche zu haben, der ihm die Aufführung seines Stückes auf
     dem Broadway sicherte. Da war der große Schauspieler, dem die
     Karriere in Hollywood winkte.

     Aber es kam anders, ganz anders.

     [They were typical of many emigrants. The businessman from
     Bielefeld, who believed he had good chances of gaining employment in
     a large department store. Then there was the famous lawyer from
     Berlin, who dreamed of receiving an offer from a large company. The
     well-known heart specialist expected to take on his own surgery. The
     author who believed he had a good connection that would secure him a
     run on Broadway. And then there was also the great actor who was
     just waiting for Hollywood to call.

     But things turned out differently, very differently. (ed. trans.)]


    Alice Herdan-Zuckmayer, Die Farm in den grünen Bergen, 1949
     __________________________________________________________________

   Our image of the artist living in exile is often associated with the
   names of successful and well-known figures. But this is misleading,
   because making it as an artist in exile means overcoming a great many
   hurdles and many don’t make it.

   For artists in particular, the circumstances in which they can produce
   their art in exile are completely new. They depend on a market for
   their art, on a public and on public tastes. They need people who
   support them, people like gallery directors and publishers who can
   distribute their work or public events like concerts or theatre
   performances. In many cases, going into exile meant finding a new
   public, writing in the language of the receiving country and adapting
   to the market conditions there. It is difficult for artists to find
   their way into and around the art business in a receiving country
   because the marketability of art works depends on a number of factors.
   How artistic quality is assessed can differ from country to country and
   praise from the critics is by no means a guarantee for economic success
   or recognition within a certain culture. The combination of country of
   origin and receiving country and the issue of a shared cultural
   heritage are also matters of significance in this respect.

   In addition to this, artists face the problem or challenge of gaining
   access to the art business in the receiving country. Many aspects play
   a role here, which do not necessarily have anything to do with artistic
   quality: for example, being able to adapt to certain customs and the
   new language, being able to gain access to important places and having
   the right contacts.

   Only seldom are artists able to continue their work where they left
   off, and they often have to prioritise commissioned work over artistic
   independence. There are numerous examples of this among those who were
   forced to live in exile outside of the Nazi sphere of influence from
   1933 to 1945: one political graphic designer, for instance, worked as a
   book designer for travel guides, while many critical writers ended up
   writing scripts for Hollywood and Jewish actors even played Nazis in
   American anti-Nazi propaganda films. At the same time, networks and
   mutual support among those living in exile were vital to continuing
   their artistic work. By setting up their own publishing houses and
   other channels for publication as well as cultural associations, those
   in exile also created structures that helped against isolation and
   aimed to provide them with employment opportunities and publicity in
   the receiving countries. However, going into exile can also lead
   artists to cease their previous artistic activities completely. If
   artists are unable to find a way into the cultural scene in their exile
   country, for example, they may have no choice but to take on any kind
   of work just to earn a living and survive.

   The impact of exile and migration on the artistic process also gives
   rise to a great many questions when we look at contemporary artists
   living in exile; for example, how easy it is for artists to enter and
   find acceptance in the cultural scene of the receiving country.

Reasons and causes of exile

     3 Fragen: 1) Kann ich in Deutschland noch schreiben, wozu es mich
     treibt? 2) Kann ich in D. leben ohne denen in [den] Rücken zu
     fallen, die das nicht mehr können, moral[isch] genommen? 3) Kann ich
     mich in D. ernähren?

     [3 questions: 1) Can I still write about what moves me in Germany?
     2) Can I still live in G. without betraying those who can no longer
     do that, from a moral perspective? 3) Can I sustain myself in G.?
     (ed. trans.)]


    Arnold Zweig on March 18, 1933 in his pocket diary
     __________________________________________________________________

   There are different reasons for going into exile depending on the
   individual fate, but they are usually related to lack of freedom and
   human rights, suppression and persecution by state authorities. Most of
   the people who have to leave their home country have been politically
   persecuted or have even had their lives threatened by a regime. For
   others, political measures make it impossible to work in their
   profession, for example, due to racist discrimination. In addition,
   there are a large number of refugees who have to flee their countries
   due to armed conflicts and hunger. Today, more than 15 million people
   are considered refugees as defined by international law.

   Artists are also affected by the fate of flight and migration: Art is
   often critical of those in power and the living conditions in a
   society.  This makes artists in dictatorial countries a target for
   state suppression. Others leave their country to be able to realise
   their own form of art for which there is no audience under the
   political conditions in their home country. Looking for freedom of
   expression and options to develop artistically, many artists also come
   to Germany these days, after the 20th century and in particular the
   Nazi era had forced an unparalleled exodus of artists and
   intellectuals.

   Immediately after they assumed power in 1933, the Nazis started to
   centrally control cultural institutions such as museums, operas and
   theatres, as well as educational institutions like universities and
   arts academies. Artistic productions were censored, modern and
   avant-garde artistry was denounced as “depraved”, disliked persons were
   forced out of their positions and professions. In the spring of 1933,
   the Nazis already organised several book burnings of works by authors
   that the regime despised and casted out for racist, political or
   aesthetic reasons. The Gestapo persecuted political artists who were
   close to social democrats or communists. Many of these artists and
   members of these two parties were the first to leave the country.

   The Nazi regime used racial discrimination laws to force Jewish artists
   out of public life and take away their rights one by one. The Nazis
   denied Jews the ability to create art in general. From 1938, after the
   November pogroms, many Jews emigrated from the German Reich – for many
   this was their last chance to save themselves by escaping.

   The GDR government also limited artistic freedom: There was no
   immediate risk to life for those who rejected having their art directed
   by the state, but the Stasi arrested artists or the state authorities
   took away their ability to work, e.g. by excluding them from artistic
   associations, censorship or banning them from their occupations.
   Before the Wall was erected, artists and many others left the GDR for
   the Federal Republic of Germany as the reinforcement of the border made
   it more difficult to leave the country. Others were expatriated as
   disliked artists even though they did not actually want to leave the
   GDR.

Exile studies in Germany

     Aufgabe der Exilforschung scheint mir demnach zu sein, das
     kommunikative und das kulturelle Gedächtnis zugleich an einem
     historisch und anthropologisch verbindlichen Gegenstand zu schulen.
     Eine solche Exilforschung [...] würde gehört und verstanden werden,
     weit über die Kreise der „Betroffenen“ und die Fachkreise hinaus.

      [Accordingly, it seems to me that the job of exile studies is to
     train both the communicative and cultural memory using a
     historically and anthropologically relevant object. Studying exile
     in this way [...] would be listened to and understood far beyond the
     circle of those “affected” and outside of academic circles. (ed.
     trans.)]


    Wolfgang Frühwald, Die „gekannt sein wollen“. Prolegomena on a theory
    of exile, 1995
     __________________________________________________________________

   What is it that exile studies deal with? The question about what
   subject matter exile research should deal with is one that has to be
   asked again and again. Today, in an era of migration, in which almost 3
   percent of the world population is made up of international migrants
   according to the German UNESCO Commission, issues such as the impact of
   exile on the countries of origin and the receiving countries, and the
   transfer of knowledge and culture are matters of interest for the world
   of research. The beginnings of exile studies are to be found in the
   early post-War period. Back then, it was those in exile who took it
   upon themselves to draw attention to the topic by providing overviews
   and anthologies about it.

   With the onset of the Cold War and the founding of two German states,
   research work became restricted by political and ideological
   influences. In the GDR, where top political and cultural posts were
   filled by returned emigrants, research work focused on communist
   resistance and anti-fascist exile. In the Federal Republic, by
   comparison, a phase began during which public discussion was
   suppressed. Instead of looking at exile, West German historians
   concentrated on the civilian, church and military opposition to the
   Nazi regime.

   It was not until the middle of the 1960s that the changing social and
   political climate saw the beginning of a new phase of critically
   examining the Nazi past. The German Exile Archive of the German
   National Library laid down the groundwork for dealing with the subject
   in its 1965 exhibition Exil-Literatur 1933-1945. Research began by
   looking at literary and political exile in congresses, symposia and
   some initial publications. In 1969, the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft
   (German Research Foundation, DFG) provided funding and soon put
   together a programme of selective measures in the area of exile
   studies. The “other Germany” and the definition of anti-fascism were
   core aspects in the West German research work. Werner Berthold wrote
   that what was needed, was something usable that went beyond the
   theoretical and he pointed out that there was a risk in this process of
   only seeking what one wants to find and only seeing part of the complex
   reality (in: Nach dem »Paradigmenwechsel«. Brita Eckert and Harro
   Kieser in conversation with Werner Berthold, 1996). The mid-1980s saw
   further change and subjects like academics in exile (and in connection
   with this a turn towards acculturation research), exile among “normal”
   people (Wolfgang Benz) and research into women’s issues and gender came
   into focus. The expansion in research work to include Jewish exile was
   also down to a change in public awareness. The television series
   Holocaust (1979), the documentary film Shoah (1985) and the controversy
   among German historians in the 1980s are all evidence of this change in
   perception. The distinction, which had prevailed for many years,
   between political exile on the one hand and non-political – mainly
   Jewish – emigration on the other was abandoned.

   In 1984 the Gesellschaft für Exilforschung (German Exile Research
   Society) was set up with Ernst Loewy as its first chairman. For many
   years now, the field of exile research has been receiving input from
   the newer cultural studies, which critically re-examine terms like
   identity and homeland and are oriented towards the future we will be
   facing due to migrational movements. What exile studies still have to
   do is render the results of decades of research into German-language
   exile from 1933 to 1945 usable for studies of contemporary migration
   and exile and to bring its area of study into line with new research
   approaches.

Résumé

   This paper utilizes qualitative and quantitative analysis to examine
   the careers of foreign (non-EU) musicians living and working in Europe,
   and in particular, the second phase of a career in classical music of
   Japanese musicians in France and Poland. It focuses on the endeavors of
   both male and female musicians to remain in the profession, in the face
   of a number of interrelated sources of inequality (i.e., socio-cultural
   origins, ethnicity, gender and class) (Winker/Degele, 2011) that have a
   structuring impact on their professional and life decisions. This
   analysis foregrounds ethnicity (nationality), socio-cultural origins,
   and socially contextualized gender as the most significant elements in
   the second stage of the career-making process. In other words, this
   article takes an intersectional stance (Crenshaw, 1995) to examine the
   process of performing a “modest” career in music for male and female
   Japanese migrant artists as a process of “working out a compromise”
   between what is desired (a passion for music and aesthetic
   satisfaction), what is professionally achievable (in France and
   Poland), and what is expected upon an eventual return to Japan.

I. Introduction

   1This article elaborates on the second stage of Japanese musicians’
   occupational careers in Europe, namely in France and in Poland. Its
   purpose is to demonstrate how male and female Japanese musicians
   inhabit a disparate socio-cultural context – both in France and Poland
   – as they continue their music career into its second phase, adapting
   to a failure to translate their music skills into a soloist career,
   which is considered the model path in the social world of classical
   music (Westby, 1960 ; Faulkner, 1973 ; Wagner, 2015). An intersectional
   analysis of this process (Crenshaw, 1995 ; Winker/Degele, 2011) will
   bring to the fore various interacting categories (i.e., age, gender,
   socio-cultural origins, ethnicity and class) that reflect the dynamics
   and main tensions in musicians’ careers – at least to an extent, since
   the Japanese remain active subjects in this process – and ultimately
   prompt musicians to accept a modest professional situation once they
   have elaborated a rationalization for this and adopted strategies for
   attaining alternative sources of satisfaction (in their professional
   and private lives) that support their occupational decisions.

   2To the best of my knowledge, no studies have systematically traced the
   professional biographies of Japanese musicians in Europe from a
   sociological stance. Scholars who have dealt with the topic of
   classical music in an Asian (i.e., Japanese) context have either
   explored the relations between Japanese or Asian and Western music
   traditions (Watanabe, 1982 ; Yang, 2007 ; Yoshihara, 2007) or presented
   individual careers viewed from an autobiographical or biographical
   perspective (cf. Ishikawa, 2001 ; Ando, 2010). Hence, this study is a
   pioneering sociological investigation of the European career
   trajectories of Japanese musicians, grounded in qualitative data.

   3Extant research on musicians’ careers in general brings into focus age
   (as a determinant of career advancement), the social practices related
   to the practice of this profession (i.e., the specificity of
   interactions, division of labor, construction of reputation) and gender
   (male and female roles in the context of reproduction and production)
   as the elements that largely shape a career in musicianship and help
   determine how it is pursued in the second stage.

   4Age brackets are associated with the “socially expected duration”
   (Merton, 1984) of phases in an ideal career model, which in the social
   world of classical music is designated by the soloist’s path (Westby,
   1960 ; Wagner, 2015). The upper age limits for prospective musicians
   have been recently lowering due to the appearance of very young Asian
   musicians on the world stage, whose high level of technical skills have
   led to increasingly fierce competition among musicians (Wagner, 2015).
   But it has generally been accepted for decades that once one reaches
   the age of 25, she enters the phase of her career trajectory when she
   can no longer expect a “turning point” (Hughes, 1971) in terms of
   achieving the status of a world-renowned music star. Orchestra
   musicians can continue to expect upward mobility for just ten years
   longer, until the age of 35 (Westby, 1960 ; Faulkner, 1973 ; Lehmann,
   2002 ; Coulangeon, 2004). The second phase of a music career begins
   around these age boundaries, and proceeds along a rather predictable
   course in terms of occupational mobility.

   5Social practices related to the execution of professional musicianship
   affect the im-/possibility of remaining in the profession. Namely, the
   specificity of a musician’s job constantly exposes instrumentalists to
   the risks of progressive deskilling (Kofman, 2012, 2016), downward
   movement and deprofessionalization if they fail to keep up with the
   minimum technical requirements of commercial projects (Faulkner, 1973,
   1983 ; Faulkner/Anderson, 1987 ; Wagner, 2015). Musicians are only as
   good as their last performance, as one once told Robert Faulkner
   (1983). This means that a music career is conditioned on instant
   performance (the quality of playing) and that a musician’s reputation
   is subject to ceaseless renegotiation. This concerns all types of
   careers, although freelancers are more vulnerable to professional
   precariousness (Coulangeon, 2004) than orchestra musicians or music
   teachers. This profession is carried out under high pressure and high
   demands in terms of performance quality, particularly for those
   pursuing freelance careers. Musicians cannot refuse a job, while each
   acceptance of a performance is decisive for the future course of their
   career. A failure to meet quality expectation can prevent future calls
   from potential employers (Faulkner, 1973, 1983 ; Faulkner/Anderson,
   1987).

   6Lastly, musicians’ careers are impacted by gender through a social
   order that in the majority of societies (depending, for example, on the
   development of an infrastructure to support working mothers) continues
   to allocate reproduction tasks to women and production duties to men
   (Ravet/Coulangeon, 2003), thus navigating their professional
   aspirations into the private and public spheres, respectively. At the
   second stage of their music career trajectory, married men and women
   may both concentrate on the practical side of their work, carried out
   to support their households in less prestigious orchestra ranks
   (Lehmann, 2002 ; Ravet/Coulangeon, 2003 ; Ravet, 2007) ; however, men
   more often seek to fulfill their aesthetic expectations outside of work
   by taking up more artistically rewarding activities, whereas women tend
   to subordinate their professional pursuits to family life.

   7The examination of 95 careers of Japanese musicians, out of which 50
   careers were studied in detail based on in-depth qualitative
   interviews, revealed that their professional pursuits in the second
   phase develop amidst such tensions, to which must be added their
   migrant status (Sayad, 1999), which affects them in a variety of ways
   (i.e. the need to obtain residence and work permits, access to jobs on
   the music market, the right to be granted social benefits, and the
   socio-cultural particularities of the sending and receiving countries)
   and frames their situation as both an emigrant and immigrant. This
   paper investigates how aging migrant-musicians coordinate their career
   in its second phase and how or to what extent their status as a migrant
   affects this career or musicians’ decision to remain in or withdraw
   from the profession.

   8The three following issues drive the analysis presented in this
   article : (1) why do Japanese musicians leave their country to
   establish themselves in Europe ; (2) how do male and female musicians
   develop their professional careers in Europe (France and Poland), and
   whether this is dependent on their being able to obtain a stable
   position in an orchestra or in academia, or are freelancing on
   short-term projects ; and (3) why do these musicians persist in their
   modest careers in spite of the occupational precariousness experienced,
   a frequently low level of job satisfaction, and moderate professional
   recognition. In other words, in focusing on the second stage of the
   professional careers of Japanese musicians, this paper aims at an
   understanding of how the migration project affects male and female
   Japanese careers objectively (work environment) by changing their
   professional situation, and subjectively (professional satisfaction,
   identification) by impacting their perception of their occupational
   track in Europe in the context of the gender order they had
   internalized earlier in Japan.

II. Methodological framework

   9The demonstration developed in this article is based on material
   retrieved with the use of three kinds of qualitative tools :
   semi-structured in-depth interviews, irregular observation, and both
   quantitative and qualitative analysis of extant data : statistics from
   websites and archives (private and institutional). The main evidence
   for tracing the experience of the first stage of musicians’ careers
   from a retrospective standpoint comes from qualitative, semi-structured
   individual interviews conducted with Japanese musicians in their mother
   tongue. 50 semi-structured interviews were carried out with male and
   female Japanese classical musicians of various specializations in their
   mother tongue. These individuals were recruited for the study on
   condition of having experience with being educated and leading a
   professional and private life in Europe (i.e., 25 interviewees were
   based in France and 25 in Poland). The vast majority of respondents
   consisted of professionally active, long-term sojourners age 30-45,
   most of whom were female pianists, especially in the Polish group.

   10I also examined 45 careers of Japanese musicians as presented in
   music competition catalogues, in the press in the form of interviews or
   articles, and on websites. To verify my findings, I discussed the
   material with 20 professionals, whom I call “experts” from the music
   milieu (i.e., music professors, sound directors, orchestra musicians
   etc.), who had previously cooperated with Japanese musicians.

   11This data has been supplemented by various informal observations
   (i.e., recitals, music lessons) ; an analysis of data from private and
   institutional archives (Fryderyk Chopin University of Music
   [hereinafter referred to as FCUM], Conservatoire national supérieur de
   musique et de danse de Paris [hereinafter referred to as CNSMDP]) ;
   official documents (i.e., statistics from music competitions,
   orchestras in France and Poland) ; and musicians’ private blogs and
   websites. I also collected statistics from music conservatories, music
   competitions, and French and Polish orchestras, and consulted both
   archives and websites to ground the results in a broader context. I
   compared two substantially disparate environments – French (with long
   migration traditions) and Polish (still relatively closed for migrants)
   – with the aim of distilling the impact that various structural and
   socio-cultural environmental idiosyncrasies have on career dynamics.

III. Leaving Japan to settle in Europe

   12The Japanese musicians travelled to Europe for educational purposes,
   at least this is how they explained their decision to move to Europe.
   Some headed abroad shortly after high school to enroll in full-time
   studies, while others waited until they graduated from university in
   Japan, with the aim of participating in a postgraduate music
   apprenticeship in Poland/France. Deeper analysis of testimonies in the
   interviews about life in Japan leads one to conclude that education was
   most likely merely a pretext concealing other reasons that prompted
   this mobility. Among the many socio-cultural aspects of life in Japan
   that fueled musicians’ migration, two elements appeared repeatedly in
   the majority of statements : (1) a gender-based division of social
   roles that today still erects barriers for women who would like to join
   the production sphere in a full-time mode, traditionally reserved for
   men, and which channels them into reproductive tasks ; (2) the working
   conditions of professional musicians in Japan. I shall briefly
   elaborate on each aspect, since both of them impact career making in
   the second phase.

A. Musicianship in the context of a patriarchal society

     * 1 ______________________________ It is interesting to note here the
       proliferation of knowledge about (...)

   13In corroboration with extant studies on the subject (Watanabe, 1982 ;
   Yoshihara, 2007 ; Yang, 2007) the research demonstrates that the
   Japanese ascribe to classical music a symbolic value as a universal
   apparatus of social distinction1. The awareness among Japanese parents
   of the practice of exposing children to music at a very young age (two
   or three years old, depending on the instrument) should be ascribed to
   the fact that the mastery of musical technique has been adopted as a
   tool of social advancement, modeled on Western mechanisms of social
   distinction. In this sense, classical music has replaced the
   traditional mechanisms which used to serve this purpose in Japan, i.e.,
   proficiency in Japanese poetic forms or Japanese instruments such as
   the koto. Private music classes offered by piano manufacturers such as
   Yamaha and Kawaii – a uniquely Japanese system of music education –
   have partly satisfied this social demand for music education (as a tool
   for social advancement).

   14In terms of a bourgeois education, notwithstanding a general social
   recognition of skills in instrument use, a paradox in the vocational
   situation of classical musicians in Japan is that transforming these
   skills into a profession is unacceptable for men. This paradox is
   closely related to the patriarchal “gender order” (Ehara, 2001) which
   still pervades in Japanese society. According to the traditional gender
   role division, a man should hold a fixed position as the one
   responsible for economically supporting the household. Both male and
   female respondents frequently emphasized that musicianship was not
   considered a masculine job, due to limited perspectives for stable and
   profitable working conditions (orchestra member or teaching post). The
   uncertainty of employment (e.g., underinvestment in the music sector,
   caused both by low public interest plus a low fertility rate, which
   affects the number of students in academia in general, and aggravates
   the problem of an oversupply of teachers) and limited prospects offered
   by the private sector (i.e., promotion, pay increases) also deem
   musicianship a “non-masculine” profession. Men can therefore be
   encouraged by their parents or schoolteachers to take up an instrument
   as long as they do not consider it a real vocational option for the
   future.

   15Contrary to this, families raise no objections against their daughter
   engaging in formal music education, estimating that music literacy,
   above all, will strengthen their position on the marital market, but
   also that musical competences can provide a future mother and wife with
   potential occupationnal activity (frequently piano teaching, which
   explains the popularity of the instrument in Japan) during free time
   following her primary duties. In other words, female musicians in Japan
   are supposed to carry out musicianship as a part-time activity, which
   matches social expectations towards women, whose first responsibilities
   in a traditional family are reproduction and care giving.

   16We will now examine the plight of the professional musician in Japan.

   17The data collected in this study lead to the conclusion that Japanese
   society’s recognition of musical literacy as a symbol of social status
   represents an imitation of conventions rooted in European social
   orders, rather than in Japanese social practices, and that classical
   musicians are not included in its hierarchy of prestigious professions.
   Note that such prestige is measured by the high income and elevated
   social position of the individual, which in patriarchal Japanese
   society are both reserved for men. Underinvestment in the Japanese
   music market (Taniguchi, 2000) and the scarcity of stable academic or
   orchestra positions render this market vulnerable to precarious working
   conditions.
     * 2 ______________________________ There were approximately 5-11
       orchestras in Tokyo in 1982, depending (...)

   18The music sector in Japan is dominated by freelance jobs such as
   e.g., private teaching, entertainment gigs such as playing in hotel
   lobbies and in restaurants in the evening, and performing at weddings
   or during cruises. According to research data, performers accept these
   jobs purely for financial reasons, while simultaneously being aware of
   the deterioration in skills that such jobs may entail. Music university
   graduates in Japan have slimmer chances in the competitive pursuit of
   positions (1) in orchestras2 and (2) tenured teaching in a high
   school/conservatoire, with the latter considered to be even more stable
   and profitable (Taniguchi, 2000 :17). Since orchestra and academic
   teaching are considered the most relatively steady social posts that
   musicians can occupy in Japan, they are chiefly reserved for men.

   19Aside from this, there exists a specific niche created out of the
   combination of a shortage of demand (positions) and oversupply of
   formally trained musicians in Japan. Namely, this is the market of
   privately held recitals, as described by respondents, where musicians
   engage their own money to perform music. These musicians face the
   problem of reconciling their hopes regarding the core activities of
   their chosen profession (playing an instrument), with harsh a reality
   (having to pay for concerts, instead of being paid for them). To play a
   concert, some musicians must handle all the “dirty work” (Hughes, 1962)
   that is usually allocated to agency staff, as one female musician
   described it :

     Hardly anybody can afford to pay for an event that costs one million
     yen. So let’s say there are three pianists who will share the
     financial burden. They have to pay for the renting fee, posters, the
     studio where they practice as well as the agent, who organizes the
     concert and also any accompanying musicians, who come from abroad :
     the plane ticket, hotel, trains and all the rest. And you have to
     sell tickets to your friends and neighbors. If the concert sells
     well, the musician may get back part of the money invested. But this
     is rarely the case. Another thing is the quality of such concerts.
     Since renting a studio for practicing is very expensive in Japan,
     they are usually able to make just one run. Surely this is
     insufficient, so during the concert, accompanying musicians adjust
     to the pianist most of the time. Frequently, these concerts are
     artistically poor. The musicians simply do not have enough time to
     work on the program together (Woman, piano, forties, Japan –
     formerly Poland).

   20The above-depicted aspects of the Japanese music milieu fuel male and
   female migration in a different way. Whereas female musicians seek
   liberation from an oppressive “gender order” (Ehara, 2001) which leaves
   hardly any space for their professional aspirations, male musicians
   head for Europe in the belief that musicianship there is associated
   with social prestige and that they will be able to find a reputable
   post (soloist position). Their life stories demonstrate that these
   expectations can be satisfied only to a limited degree, and that this
   is conditioned by the type of career these musicians manage to
   establish, as well as by the country of immigration, and their gender –
   male and female musicians experienced the second stage of their
   professional career in different ways, mostly due to family life.

B. Locked into a career trajectory

     * 3 ______________________________ Note that both career paths are
       structurally constrained, yet these (...)

   21In the second phase of their career, musicians realize that further
   significant career movements become a goal hard to achieve for a
   combination of reasons, including nationality, institutions3
   (Allmendinger/Hackman/Lehman, 1996), age, and musical specialization.
   Notwithstanding this combination of impediments, musicians who are
   unable to move their career or family life back to Japan, tend to “cool
   out” (Goffman, 1952) and adapt to the circumstances of the receiving
   country, where they develop a life mode that both provides grounds for
   rationalizations to continue their musicianship and substitutes for
   aspirations (status) that cannot be fully satisfied abroad. The main
   differences in the career process stem from the type of career pursued,
   but they are also divided along gender lines : (1) male musicians
   continue musicianship by combining the prestige of an orchestra
   position alongside activities outside this work which compensate for
   its unsatisfactory status (defined by low job discretion, routine,
   transparency of the orchestra member playing in unison) ; (2) female
   musicians find fulfillment in both the professional and private spheres
   of their life by assuming the life stability of a mother, who is then
   socially permitted to take up a regular work activity. Women’s
   acceptance of their professional situation is forged always in relation
   to their presupposed role and status in their home country.

   22What both male and female musicians have in common, however, is the
   fact that each category has achieved a certain life trajectory, the
   abandonment of which would generate costs higher than maintaining it.
   In other words, these musicians are locked into a career trajectory
   conditioned in a number of ways (by nationality, gender, age, civil
   status, Japanese social practices and institutions in the sphere of
   music and family life, country of immigration), although each of them
   distinguishes itself from the other with its own peculiarities. I shall
   first elaborate on elements that constitute both of the two identified
   trajectory patterns, and then examine some extreme cases of musicians
   who eventually drifted away from music.

1. Male musicians – redefining professional status after hours

   23Male musicians aim more often than women at a prestigious status
   (i.e., soloist posts or a solo stand in the orchestra) and career
   advancement. Yet, Asian socio-cultural origins act as a source of
   stereotypes, typecasting Japanese instrumentalists as technically
   skilled performers, whose playing, however, can reveal their
   insufficient musicality, undermining their endeavors to compete for
   reputable positions. Ethnicity thus decides about the Japanese music
   capabilities, as demonstrated by the passage below :

     If French and Asians perform the same piece, the later has to be
     twice or three times as good as the former to get any recognition.
     That is my impression. The French are simply given preference. I
     find nothing strange about it. It has nothing to do with nationalism
     or anything (Man, violin, forties, France).

   24Having realized that their position on the local music market is far
   from privileged, irrespective of their competences which are frequently
   confirmed with certificates from top music academies (i.e., CNSMDP,
   FCUM), some male musicians may try their chances in Japan.
   Unfortunately, their experiences teach them that integration into the
   Japanese music market after having spent years abroad is not easy,
   especially if they seek professional advancement. A failure to make
   desirable occupational changes is a crucial reason for continuing their
   careers abroad, as illustrated by the evidence below :

     At one point, I was really exhausted, and thought that I’d rather go
     back to Japan than stay here, but it didn’t go well, and here I am,
     like I was back then. Well, a post vacated in a Japanese orchestra
     and I tried out for the audition, but I failed. For one moment, I
     really wanted to quit the place where I am now. At that time, I just
     got tired. I felt that it wasn’t interesting anymore. When you’ve
     been doing it (playing) for dozens of years, it just happens one
     day. Over the twenty years that passed, I’ve experienced many
     different situations. Let’s take compositions, for instance, the
     ensemble usually plays 3 or 4 pieces every week. There are good
     classic artworks, and then there is the contemporary music, which is
     so chaotic that you can’t make head or tail of it, but you have to
     play it. It makes me tired and bored sometimes. Of course, I play
     the best way I can, but I’m unable to feel any pleasure playing the
     music. Here I belong to tutti, but in Japan I passed the audition
     for the top position. What went wrong ? I presume, it was my
     inability to keep eye contact and effective communication with the
     other top musician. In Japan, it is very important to be careful
     while working with others, and I just didn’t know that, because when
     I play I’m kind of concentrated on what I’m doing at a specific
     moment. I intended to become a top player in a Japanese orchestra
     and then develop my solo career (Man, cello, sixties, France).

   25At the same time, musicians dissatisfied with their professional
   status develop an alternative professional life, where they can follow
   their aesthetic plans and preferences (i.e., present their skills on
   stage performing solo a repertoire they personally selected) that
   provide a status that better matches their aspirations. A trombonist
   explained his decision to launch a subsequent artistic enterprise in
   the following way :

     We established the quartet because we wanted to create music
     independently and autonomously, because when you play in the
     orchestra you have to play the way the conductor tells you to and
     you have no choice (Man, trombone, fifties, Poland).

   26Therefore, on the one hand, on orchestra position does not seem to be
   a dream job for male instrumentalists, who aim at soloist careers due
   to the numerous limitations an orchestra imposes on its members. Such
   aspects include (1) monotony (repetitiveness of tasks) and routine
   (short performing time, unison sound in the tutti section) ; (2) lack
   of impact on the performance content – low job discretion
   (Allmendinger/Hackman/Lehman, 1996 :194) – in that both the selection
   and interpretation of the repertoire (the object of the work) lie in
   hands of the artistic management of the institution or the conductor ;
   and (3) few artistic/technical challenges, all of which affect
   professional satisfaction among symphony musicians (Westby, 1960). On
   the other hand, the stable income and easy resolution of residence and
   work permit issues that an orchestral position guarantees, leaves a
   space for the creation of a proxy position, which substitutes for the
   desired social status. In such instances, male musicians ground their
   professional identification (Becker/Strauss, 1956) more on the activity
   carried out outside their workplace. This strategy helps them to
   rationalize and accept their “modest” career in the orchestra.

2. Female musicians – limited living stability instead of occupational
ambitions

   27The majority of female musicians believe that by establishing
   themselves in Europe they managed to leave behind a complex “glass
   ceiling” (Morrison/White/Velsor, 1987 ; Buscatto/Marry, 2009) combining
   the mechanisms of rigidly defined gender roles and class affiliation
   that pushes women out of the productive sphere, and would have
   undermined their professional ambitions had they stayed in Japan. An
   examination of their situation reveals a different kind of
   intersectional trap they fall into in Europe, one which is their
   ethnicity (nationality) and socio-cultural origins, as well as their
   age, marital status and gender. Therefore, paradoxically, in seeking to
   bypass the limitations of the music milieu in their home country, these
   women find themselves facing a disparate set of obstacles which frames
   their professional path in a no less restricting manner in Europe than
   it would in Japan. In continuing their career in Europe, these Japanese
   female musicians sustain their belief in the success of the
   emancipation (from a patriarchal gender order) project that has brought
   them all the way from Japan to Europe.

   28Based on the type of work activity, marital status and country of
   residence, the career trajectories of female musicians split further
   into three patterns : (1) full-time working mothers ; (2) freelancing
   mothers focused on family life ; and (3) freelance single female
   musicians determined to stay in Europe, working to prolong their visas
   and support themselves.

a. Social emancipation of full-time working mothers

     * 4 ______________________________ In this respect, Japanese women
       resemble Irish women, who migrated t (...)

   29These women attach high importance to the possibility of turning
   their musical technique into an occupation, forging a career4 in
   Europe, and hence obtaining relative financial stability through their
   job (regardless of their civil status). The interaction of several
   categorizing elements combine to construct the social position of an
   individual ; these include age, education, class and ethnic origins, as
   well as the instrument played. These narrow these women’s employment
   chances, as illustrated by the following quote :

     You have to expect that around 30-40 candidates will apply for one
     post (one of the violinists said that today there are approximately
     80 candidates for one violin post). In the case of oboe, there are
     only a few positions, so you are really lucky when a position
     becomes vacant. (...) The idea to give up the instrument altogether
     has never even crossed my mind. (…) I’d passed some twenty auditions
     in different European countries (Germany, Switzerland, Finland and
     of course, France), but I wasn’t accepted anywhere. (…) I just
     didn’t want to stay in Europe just to ‘be in Europe’, I wanted to be
     able to work here. (...) I really practiced a lot, honestly. So
     much, that even I myself was convinced that I was really doing my
     best. I was so determined to get a job. And there were hard moments.
     In Germany, for instance, in the last stage of the audition they
     asked me if I had a valid visa and when I said “no” someone from the
     selection committee responded that they were looking for a really
     passionate musician and not for a person who was most probably
     seeking a job to get a visa. Still I didn’t want to give up. (…) I
     blew the instrument for so many hours, driven by the thought that
     what I wanted most was to get into an orchestra. (…) I passed more
     than twenty auditions to get here, where I work now. This was the
     twenty-fifth, can you imagine ? (Woman, forties, oboe, France).

   30In the given circumstances these women find professional satisfaction
   in having landed any stable position in an orchestra or in academia.
   Once they have a family, Japanese women “cool out” (Goffman, 1952) and
   learn to

     redirect their concerns away from the place of work toward other
     scenes in their social life, (…) turn(ing) down those experiences
     that they can actively shape for themselves, toward those places
     where they can be somebody special, and where they can retreat from
     the occupational career struggle as well as some of the duller and
     even degrading moments of music making in the symphony (p.347).

   31Work attains a different meaning for female-married musicians in the
   second stage of their professional life. It furnishes them with life
   stability in terms of their legal (visa, work permit) status ;
   socio-economic independence from their husband and conjugal contract ;
   social benefits ; regular working hours, which leave time for family
   life ; paid leave and maternity leave ; health and social insurance ;
   and a pension. Thus the work-life balance achieved creates alternative
   grounds on which these women redefine their social role, fitting it
   into the working mother pattern. Faulkner (1973) described this type of
   additional gratification located in private life (i.e., time spent with
   children, family, partner, hobbies) as

     incidental ‘side benefits’ (that) are realized in the private sphere
     (Berger/Kellner, 1964), (and which) have a profound effect on
     dampening motivations to move onward and upward (p.346).

   32The female musicians from the studied group who were full-time
   orchestra members (in Europe) were entitled to maternity leave, and
   thus did not experience institutional pressures to quit their job due
   to care-giving duties.

   33Lastly, there were significant differences between the Polish and
   French institutional infrastructures designed to support working
   mothers. In Poland, structural insufficiencies in the caregiving sector
   force mothers who plan to recapture their professional activity to rely
   on care provided by the family, a support mechanism on which the
   Japanese women living in Poland cannot always count. In France, the
   structural organization of the public support offered to families,
   i.e., relatively easy access to public child care and so-called aides
   au logement (AL), that is, housing benefits intended for households
   that purchase or rent an apartment and which are granted under certain
   conditions, renders the working environment there far more
   mother-friendly. In this sense, motherhood gave the Japanese women
   residing in France the right to profit from social support that partly
   compensated for the ethnic inequalities they experienced when competing
   for positions on the music market. No such mechanisms that could
   alleviate the impact of the social categories that affect one’s power
   position (i.e., gender, ethnicity/nationality, music specialty, class,
   age) exist in Poland, where married Japanese women rarely have the
   opportunity to emancipate themselves from the patriarchal family
   scheme, and remain dependent on their spouses not only economically,
   but also legally (due to visa-related issues).

b. Freelancing mothers in France and Poland

   34The occupational situation of freelancing musician mothers in France,
   who tend to be in relationships with professional musicians, differs
   from that in Poland due to the former group’s access to better work
   opportunities through their spouses, which allows female
   instrumentalists in France to lead a more active occupational life of a
   musician (having jobs almost every day) than their compatriots in
   Poland (occasionally participating in music events). What they share
   are life priorities centered on childrearing and family life.
     * 5 ______________________________ Aside from permanent positions,
       orchestras offer also temporary cont (...)

   35In France musicians of specializations other than the piano (winds,
   strings) usually support themselves by working as orchestra substitutes
   or giving private music lessons5. In addition, music schools contract
   some pianists, where they mainly accompany music students, yet are
   rarely asked to independently lead a music class. What distinguishes
   these women and brings them closer to female musicians from the first
   category is that they too have managed to build a working environment
   that produces a “stability illusion”. Firstly, conjugal relations solve
   work and residence permit issues, while their partners’ profession –
   most of them are married to musicians – facilitates their access to the
   music market. Their daily work agenda is filled with duties (they carry
   out remunerated part-time jobs almost every day, at least three-four
   times a week) but they are to some extent free to choose projects that
   suit them (because their spouse contributes to the household budget).
   Here again, the French welfare system, contrary to that in Poland,
   lends a helping hand to working mothers.

   36In comparison, respondents based in Poland – mostly pianists – set
   their careers in motion around Chopin’s music, which they perform
   occasionally (approximately ten times a year at most) as soloists or
   with small ensembles (three to four people) during festivals, as well
   as at other music events. Additionally, they offer private music
   lessons at home and are also engaged in part-time jobs unrelated to
   music (e.g., translation, interpreting piano lessons for Japanese
   students during master classes held at FCUM twice a year, working a
   tourist guides or writing about Europe in the context of classical
   music for the Japanese media). Since these paid musical events happen
   rather sporadically (several times a week), it is difficult to speak
   about developed work activity, especially if we juxtapose this with
   freelancing in France. This situation shall be ascribed to structural
   conditions within the music market in Poland, which offers less work
   opportunities to classical musicians. Yet no less important is the fact
   that the Japanese in Poland have established families with
   professionals from sectors other than music (media, marketing,
   accounting, consulting). These men scarcely encourage their wives to
   continue their musicianship, nor can they meditate adequate working
   opportunities ; however, they do not prevent their partners-musicians
   from playing. Women confess that they can count on their husband’s
   support (i.e., aid in childcare) whenever they want to participate in a
   music project. In this sense, a Western family model, where both
   partners engage in professional activity, is also operative here,
   allowing these women the opportunity to remain musically active and
   take up work while running a house. However, after having a child,
   Japanese women in Poland suspend their playing altogether, believing
   they can suspend their vocational life until after they return from
   childcare leave, and continue to favor their motherly and housewife
   duties. The interview material documented the hardships of such efforts
   to return, and elicited reflections on how they identified with their
   profession, as documented by the excerpt below :

     I spent really long years at home raising children, and so I had
     plenty of time to think about ‘who we call a pianist’. Is a pianist
     only a person appearing on glittering stages, in the media, the
     press, a person who wins competitions ? Is this the real pianist ?
     And I started thinking that this is only one way. My way is to do
     what only I can do, at a certain time and place, where people need
     me, or want to listen to my performances. That is how in the past
     ten years I have come to be able to get back to work step-by-step. I
     haven’t been recognized with the title of music competition awardee,
     but I played in more familiar places, closer to where I live, in
     small Cultural Centers. There is nothing to be ashamed of when
     performing in a village hall. When you limit the definition of a
     pianist solely to those who are great stars, then you have to ask
     yourself a question : are they still having a splendid career ten or
     twenty years after they had won the competition ? I have managed to
     overcome social opinions, common sense and imagination and my own
     complexes, and this way it seems to me that I have found a place
     where I can be a pianist (Woman, piano, fifties, Poland).

   37The group of women just depicted persist in their modest career in
   the second phase, weaving it out of sporadic music events, providing
   that they cast anew their professional identification as a musician and
   accept their occupational trajectory running a different track than the
   soloist’s model as one possible path among many.

c. Single freelancing Japanese women – working for a visa

       freelancing musicians in Poland. Afte (...)
     * 7 ______________________________ This solution is not unique to
       France, but is partly implemented in (...)

   38Both French and Polish migration law constrains the scope of artistic
   freelancing for foreigners residing in these countries6. Since 2014
   Polish law does not provide any legal opportunity for freelancing
   artists to engage in their vocation, which means that this category of
   people will completely vanish from the legal sphere. Contrary to this,
   the French legal system had provided a space for foreigners and their
   creative activity, admitting that these people can contribute to the
   development of French culture. Furthermore, France has a long tradition
   of supporting freelancing artists, and the intermittent du spectacle7
   system, which constitutes a living mode for many French artists,
   including legally residing foreign artists, provides but one piece of
   evidence of this fact.

   39Notwithstanding the above, the study’s data demonstrates that in
   either country, Japanese artists, preoccupied with fulfilling
   eligibility criteria, have little time left to make a contribution,
   because they are frequently engaged in activities that do not even
   match their interests, yet in their opinion might have administrative
   value (allow them to extend their work and residence permit). In such
   circumstances, musicians find themselves trapped in a precarious
   situation (i.e., non-stable jobs, changing legal regulations and music
   market conditions), which consequently forces them to accept any job
   they are offered.
     * 8 ______________________________ Khodyakov D. (2007) analyzes
       relationships in the Orpheus orchestra, (...)

   40The research material indicates three interrelated elements that
   generate uncertainty on the level of artistic action : (1) the quality
   of networks (that may “defrost”) (Wagner, 2015) ; (2) the act of
   cooperation itself, which involves other people, is based on mutual
   trust (Faulkner/Anderson, 1987 ; Menger, 2010) and requires conformity
   as well as cooperation with the inner group (Becker, 2008), and the
   “trust-control relationship”8 (Khodyakov, 2007) ; (3) the work
   contract, characterized by a short duration (i.e., one concert, series
   of recording, two-month teaching) and usually its one-off form
   (non-renewable), very often with no or limited social or health
   security, and where remuneration conditions are determined vaguely.

   41Some research points out that freelancing provides musician with
   freedom of choice in that they can select between projects that are
   compatible with their needs and that satisfy their esthetic
   sensibilities (Lehmann, 2002 ; Ravet/Coulangeon, 2003). However, data
   from the interviews shows that musicians frequently accept whatever
   they are offered because they never know what evidence will be
   sufficiently convincing for the immigration officer to prolong their
   residence permit. In other words, since migration law is modified quite
   frequently, musicians organize their activity strategically,
   diversifying their occupational activity to increase their chances in
   the “visa game” as one pianist describes it :

     The Compétences et talents card is granted to artists who do a great
     deal of things even if they do not have fixed employment. I have a
     fixed job, yet at the same time, I have students in individual
     lessons, and I play concerts and record CDs. I’m trying to diversify
     my activities, you never know when and how the law will change
     (Woman, piano, thirties, France).

   42The interviewed musicians confessed that they try to make their
   timetables and themselves as flexible as possible, ready to accept any
   offers (for a concert, festival, recordings) that might arise (“if you
   refuse, they might not call you again”). They practice mastering a
   repertoire and broadening it in order to be able to respond to varied
   market needs (Faulkner/Anderson, 1987) and thus pay the rent or renew
   their visas. If the cooperation terminates, the musician might lose
   right to reside and work in the country.

   43Becker and Strauss (1956) argued that a

     ‘fine artist’ may be committed to artistic ideals but seize upon
     whatever jobs are at hand to help him toward creative goals. When he
     takes a job in order to live, he thereby risks committing himself to
     an alternative occupational career ; and artists and writers do,
     indeed, get weaned away from the exercise of their art in just this
     way (p.260).

   44Freelancers more often take up commercial projects whose performance
   is not as technically demanding as the playing of classical pieces of
   music, and hence their skills are exposed to “deskilling” (Kofman,
   2012, 2016). Progressive deskilling is risky since insufficient
   technique may one day exclude them from the market.

   45Regardless of their precarious working situation and ambiguous
   professional identification, freelancing musicians do not give up on
   their musicianship. They make an effort to carry on with their careers,
   less for financial reasons (to contribute to the family budget, or to
   earn pocket money) than for the need to stay professionally active,
   even to a limited extent, and out of a fear of losing their music
   skills, the acquirement of which required at great expense in terms of
   time, money and personal commitment (discipline of practicing
   regularly). In light of this, the question then arises : why do some
   musicians eventually give up their musicianship ?

C. Swerving careers

   46A professional change for a musician is never an easy decision, as
   the cost of entering the profession is extremely high, as Sorignet
   (2004) evidenced in his study about retiring modern dancers. For the
   musician, it means that she has invested in vain a great amount of time
   and effort expended in mastering the instrument, and long hours of
   training at the expense of acquiring other skills (in science, for
   example). She must look for an alternative vocational route.

   47The research data shows us that musicians do resign in the second
   phase of their careers. This is not an abrupt cutoff, but rather a slow
   process, at the end of which they do maintain some music-related
   activity. The group studied contains two examples of professional
   conversion, but only one of them is relevant for the analysis presented
   in this paper. The first one occurred right after graduation from music
   studies, when the instrumentalist failed to find any occupation linked
   to music skills possessed. This example suggests that full withdrawal
   happens very rarely when a person is unable to find any music-related
   job or when entering musicianship was never the person’s individual
   decision, but rather the fulfillment of parental dreams.

   48The person, who progressively diversified her career, previously
   worked in academia and for an orchestra, occasionally giving recitals
   (a few times a year). Having reached a certain age (her thirties), she
   realized that further upward career mobility would be virtually
   impossible, so she started developing non-music related activities. We
   need to remember that age is a crucial element in a musician’s career.
   This thirty-year-old pianist was aware of the slim chances she had to
   experience a turning point in their career. As in the case of the
   athletes examined by Adlers (1985), musicians’ social status evolves
   from belief to disbelief, as they compare themselves to other
   virtuosos, verifying their chances in the labor market, in the context
   of their age, networks and skills. A process of “pragmatic detachment”
   (Adler/Adler, 1985) from the goal of becoming a professional musician
   unfolds similarly to the one experienced by athletes, who learn that
   their chances of becoming a professional sportsman are incredibly slim,
   even more difficult than graduating from university. Musicians seem to
   realize that they cannot wait endlessly for their “chance”, doing other
   things and trying to maintain their skills at a high level.

   49In the case of the above-mentioned woman, her career-related
   self-consciousness was accompanied by her plans in private life, namely
   her wish to have a baby. A stable, contracted position was supposed to
   provide her with the privileges of full-time employment, such as social
   and health insurance, a pension, paid sick and maternity leave, which
   she would benefit from as a mother. This case demonstrates an
   “occupational role progression” trajectory (Goffman, 1959). After a
   person has reached certain age, if her career has not developed beyond
   a certain threshold, she gradually shifts to different career path and
   prepares to enter a different stage of life (childrearing). As Becker
   and Strauss (1956) contended

     (w)hen careers are in danger of being brought to an abrupt end – as
     with airplane pilots – then, before retirement, other kinds of
     careers may be prepared for or entered. This precaution is very
     necessary. When generalized mobility is an aim, specific routes may
     be chosen for convenience sake (p. 260).

   50In the case of the mother-musician, it is plausible that an
   alternative career path was etched in her life-plan, which included
   enlarging her family sometime in the future.

IV. Conclusion

   51Japanese female and male musicians who settle in Europe propelled by
   the dream of socio-professional emancipation from the constraints
   imposed in Japan, persist in careers which do not match these
   expectations in hardly any aspect. Previous studies of modest careers
   in the art world have spotlighted numerous aspects that characterize
   these professional artistic trajectories, focusing in particular on the
   scarcity of stable positions and related-job insecurity as well as
   their precariousness (Coulangeon, 2004), which force artists (including
   musicians) to engage in multiple art-related activities
   (Bureau/Perrenoud/Shapiro, 2009) and, in consequence, lead a “double
   life” (Lahire, 2006). Scholars have also frequently brought to the fore
   age (Westby, 1960 ; Wagner, 2015) and gender as (Ravet/Coulangeon,
   2003 ; Ravet, 2007) as two traits that lay the grounds for
   discriminatory practices still institutionally sanctioned, especially
   in the conservative world of classical music. Extant research has
   explained a subjective devotion to artistic creation that overcomes the
   above-depicted professional hardships through a “passion” for art (and
   music), usually coupled with an artistic “vocation” (Moulin, 1983 ;
   Lehmann, 2002 ; Heinich, 2005 ; Buscatto, 2007).

   52An intersectional analysis of the occupational paths in Europe of
   Japanese musicians provides us with a more complex view, and hence a
   more multidimensional understanding, of modest artistic (international)
   careers since it embraces all the above-mentioned elements (i.e., the
   specificity of the music labor market characterized by job insecurity,
   precariousness ; gender and age) and additionally combines them with
   ethnicity and (related) migration status, and local migration law
   alongside the social and cultural capital that musicians acquire during
   their stay abroad. The latter set of career features remains
   significant in particular for artists who are non-EU citizens seeking
   to establish themselves in Europe, in that these features frame and
   fuel modest careers in their second stage.

   53A passion for music tied with gender roles as defined in Japanese
   society have triggered “emancipation projects” that navigated Japanese
   musicians to Europe. If they continue their European careers, which are
   generally far from the ideal model of a career in music, it is because
   1) they have already achieved some “limited occupational activity” as
   migrants, 2) withdrawing from this path would put at stake this
   stability and require them to admit an emancipatory failure, or 3)
   those who have established households (in particular female musicians)
   cannot easily transplant their non-Japanese families to Japan. In this
   sense, their modest careers at the second stage reveal a compromise
   between what is desired (a passion for music and aesthetic
   satisfaction), what is professionally achievable (in France and Poland)
   for both male and female Japanese migrant artists, and what is expected
   upon an eventual return to Japan.

Structured Summary

   Presentation : Previous studies of modest careers in the art world have
   spotlighted numerous aspects that characterize these professional
   artistic trajectories, focusing in particular on the scarcity of stable
   positions and related-job insecurity as well as their precariousness
   (Coulangeon, 2004), which force artists (including musicians) to engage
   in multiple art-related activities (Bureau/Perrenoud/Shapiro, 2009)
   and, in consequence, lead a “double life” (Lahire, 2006). Scholars have
   also frequently brought to the fore age (Westby, 1960 ; Wagner, 2015)
   and gender as (Ravet/Coulangeon, 2003 ; Ravet, 2007) as two traits that
   lay the grounds for discriminatory practices still institutionally
   sanctionned, especially in the conservative world of classical music.
   Extant research has explained a subjective devotion to artistic
   creation that overcomes the above-depicted professional hardships
   through a “passion” for art (and music), usually coupled with an
   artistic “vocation” (Moulin, 1983 ; Lehmann, 2002 ; Heinich, 2005 ;
   Buscatto, 2007). The purpose of this article is to demonstrate how male
   and female Japanese musicians inhabit a disparate socio-cultural
   context – both in France and Poland – as they continue their music
   career into its second phase, adapting to a failure to translate their
   music skills into a soloist career, which is considered the model path
   in the social world of classical music (Westby, 1960 ; Faulkner, 1973 ;
   Wagner, 2015).

   Method : The demonstration developed in this article is based on
   material retrieved with the use of three kinds of qualitative tools :
   semi-structured in-depth interviews, irregular observation, and both
   quantitative and qualitative analysis of extant data : statistics from
   websites and archives (private and institutional). The main evidence
   for tracing the experience of the first stage of musicians’ careers
   from a retrospective standpoint comes from qualitative, semi-structured
   individual interviews conducted with Japanese musicians in their mother
   tongue. 50 semi-structured interviews were carried out with male and
   female Japanese classical musicians of various specializations in their
   mother tongue. These individuals were recruited for the study on
   condition of having experience with being educated and leading a
   professional and private life in Europe (i.e., 25 interviewees were
   based in France and 25 in Poland). The vast majority of respondents
   consisted of professionally active, long-term sojourners age 30-45,
   most of whom were female pianists, especially in the Polish group. In
   addition to that I also examined 45 careers of Japanese musicians as
   presented in music competition catalogues, in the press in the form of
   interviews or articles, and on websites. To verify my findings, I
   discussed the material with 20 professionals, whom I call “experts”
   from the music milieu (i.e., music professors, sound directors,
   orchestra musicians, etc.), who had previously cooperated with Japanese
   musicians.

   Theory : This analysis foregrounds ethnicity (nationality),
   socio-cultural origins, and socially contextualized gender as the most
   significant elements in the second stage of the career-making process.
   It focuses on the endeavors of both male and female musicians to remain
   in the profession, in the face of a number of interrelated sources of
   inequality (i.e., socio-cultural origins, ethnicity, gender and class)
   (Winker/Degele, 2011) that have a structuring impact on their
   professional and life decisions. This analysis foregrounds ethnicity
   (nationality), socio-cultural origins, and socially contextualized
   gender as the most significant elements in the second stage of the
   career-making process. In other words, this article takes an
   intersectional stance (Crenshaw, 1995) to examine the process of
   performing a “modest” career in music for male and female Japanese
   migrant artists as a process of “working out a compromise” between what
   is desired (a passion for music and aesthetic satisfaction), what is
   professionally achievable (in France and Poland), and what is expected
   upon an eventual return to Japan.

   Results : The article shows that a passion for music tied with gender
   roles as defined in Japanese society have triggered “emancipation
   projects” that navigated Japanese musicians to Europe. If they continue
   their European careers, which are generally far from the ideal model of
   a career in music, it is because 1) they have already achieved some
   “limited occupational activity” as migrants, 2) withdrawing from this
   path would put at stake this stability and re-quire them to admit an
   emancipatory failure, or 3) those who have established households (in
   particular female musicians) cannot easily transplant their
   non-Japanese families to Japan. In this sense, their modest careers at
   the second stage reveal a compromise between what is desired (a passion
   for music and aesthetic satisfaction), what is professionally
   achievable (in France and Poland) for both male and female Japanese
   migrant artists, and what is expected upon an eventual return to Japan.

   Discussion : This article contributes to sociological studies of
   creative careers. The framework developed in this article shall help
   examine and understand various conditions that shape professional
   musicianship and at the same time affect the im-/possibility of
   remaining in the profession in the second stage. The application of an
   intersectional approach to the occupational paths of transnational
   musicians provides us with a more multidimensional understanding of
   modest artistic (international) careers, since it embraces such
   elements as ex. the specificity of the music labor market characterized
   by job insecurity, precariousness ; gender and age and additionally
   combines them with ethnicity and (related) migration status, and local
   migration law alongside the social and cultural capital that musicians
   acquire during their stay abroad.

Notes

   1 ______________________________ It is interesting to note here the
   proliferation of knowledge about the benefits of early engagement in
   music education, which seems to be broader in Japan than in European
   countries, where it remains frequently reserved for families with
   musical socio-professional origins.

   2 ______________________________ There were approximately 5-11
   orchestras in Tokyo in 1982, depending on the source of data (Watanabe
   M., 1982, p.715). In March 2016 the Association of Japanese Symphony
   Orchestras (established in 1990 and recognized as a corporate juridical
   person by the Japanese Ministry of Culture and Science, Monbukagakusho)
   associated 34 professional orchestras in Japan,
   http://www.orchestra.or.jp/about/federation/, accessed 2 April 2017.

   3 ______________________________ Note that both career paths are
   structurally constrained, yet these constraints interrelate differently
   with nationality. Posts in academia in France and Poland belong to the
   public sector, which prevents an influx of foreigners by having raised
   institutional obstacles (i.e., a specific career path in the course of
   which a person attains subsequent grades and diplomas). Furthermore,
   top positions (the first instrument in the section) are scarce, and
   become vacant only when the former top musician retires due to age
   constraints, or for personal reasons. Orchestras may favor musicians
   with the same nationality, but these are informal impediments (e.g.
   informal favoring local candidates over foreigners driven by the
   policies of orchestra unions). It is then it this sense that the world
   of orchestra seems to be much more inclusive when it comes to
   foreigners in comparison to academia.

   4 ______________________________ In this respect, Japanese women
   resemble Irish women, who migrated to UK or United States, seeking
   social emancipation (Stalker P., 1994), as well as Italian women, who
   were leaving the country propelled by similar reasons (Kofman E.,
   2012).

   5 ______________________________ Aside from permanent positions,
   orchestras offer also temporary contracts, when the performed
   repertoire requires larger ensembles. For example Gustav Mahler’s
   Symphony No. 8 engages 44 violinists.

   6 ______________________________ There is little legal room for
   freelancing musicians in Poland. After the law changed in 2014,
   freelancers apply for the stay permit as “Other”, having to justify
   their reasons for staying in Poland (for example participation in a
   volunteer program), and to prove a regular monthly income that covers
   living costs equal to the amount that entitles a person to social
   security benefits, which was calculated to be 674PLN, approximately 160
   EUR for a single person household,

   accessed 8 February 2016. The lawmaker France offers more possibilities
   for freelancing artists. One of them is Carte compétences et talents
   (Skills and talent card), which since 2006 has been intended for
   artists, who plan to carry out a remunerated or non-remunerated

Banishment from Paris of Germaine de Staël

   She was also an important political figure and was regarded by
   contemporary Europe as the personal enemy of Napoleon. With Constant
   and his friends she formed the nucleus of a liberal resistance that so
   embarrassed Napoleon that in 1803 he had her banished to a distance of
   40 miles (64 km) from Paris. Thenceforward Coppet was her headquarters,
   and in 1804 she began what she called, in a work published posthumously
   in 1821, her Dix Années d’exil (Ten Years’ Exile). From December 1803
   to April 1804 she made a journey through Germany, culminating in a
   visit to Weimar, already established as the shrine of J.W. von Goethe
   and Friedrich von Schiller. In Berlin she met August Wilhelm von
   Schlegel, who was to become, after 1804, her frequent companion and
   counselor. Her guide in Germany, however, was a young Englishman, Henry
   Crabb Robinson, who was studying at Jena. The journey was interrupted
   in 1804 by news of the death of her father, whom she had always greatly
   admired. His death affected her deeply, but in 1805 she set out for
   Italy, accompanied by Schlegel and Simonde de Sismondi, the Genevan
   economist who was her guide on the journey. Returning in June 1805, she
   spent the next seven years of her exile from Paris for the most part at
   Coppet.

   While Corinne can be considered the result of her Italian journey, the
   fruits of her visit to Germany are contained in her most important
   work, De l’Allemagne (1810; Germany). This is a serious study of German
   manners, literature and art, philosophy and morals, and religion in
   which she made known to her contemporaries the Germany of the Sturm und
   Drang movement (1770–1780). Its only fault is the distorted picture it
   gives, ignoring, for example, the violently nationalistic aspect of
   German Romanticism. Napoleon took it for an anti-French work, and the
   French edition of 1810 (10,000 copies) was seized and destroyed. It was
   finally published in England in 1813.

   Meanwhile Mme de Staël, persecuted by the police, fled from Napoleon’s
   Europe. Having married, in 1811, a young Swiss officer, “John” Rocca,
   in May 1812 she went to Austria and, after visiting Russia, Finland,
   and Sweden, arrived, in June 1813, in England. She was received with
   enthusiasm, although reproached by such liberals as Lord Byron for
   being more anti-Napoleonic than liberal and by the Tories for being too
   liberal. Her guide in England was Sir James Mackintosh, the Scottish
   publicist. She collected documents for, but never wrote, a De
   l’Angleterre: (the material for it can be found in the Considérations
   sur la Révolution française [1818; Considerations on the Principal
   Events of the French Revolution], which represents a return to Necker’s
   ideas and holds up the English political system as a model for France).

   On the Bourbon Restoration in 1814, Mme de Staël returned to Paris but
   was deeply disillusioned: the fall of Napoleon had been followed by
   foreign occupation and had in no way reestablished liberty in France.
   During the Hundred Days she escaped to Coppet and in September 1815 set
   out again for Italy. In 1816 she returned to spend the summer at
   Coppet, where she was joined by Byron, in flight from England after his
   unhappy matrimonial experience. A strong friendship developed between
   the two writers.

   Mme de Staël’s health was declining. After Byron’s departure she went
   to Paris for the winter. Though poorly received by the returned émigrés
   and suspected by the government, she held her salon throughout the
   winter and part of the spring, but after April 1817 she was an invalid.
   She died in Paris in July of that year.

Legacy

   Germaine de Staël’s purely literary importance is far exceeded by her
   importance in the history of ideas. Her novels and plays are now
   largely forgotten, but the value of her critical and historical work is
   undeniable. Though careless of detail, she had a clear vision of wider
   issues and of the achievements of civilization. Her involvement in, and
   understanding of, the events and tendencies of her time gave her an
   unusual position: it may be said that she helped the dawning 19th
   century to take stock of itself.

Living conditions and everyday life in exile

     Ich bin immer noch dabei, mir eine neue Existenz aufzubauen, und da
     es zum vierten Male in meinem Leben ist, so faellt es nicht immer
     ganz leicht.

     [I am still in the process of establishing myself, and since this is
     the fourth time in my life, it’s not always easy. (ed. trans.)]


    Architect Franz Hillinger, employee of Bruno Taut in Turkey, in a
    letter from Canada to the governing Mayor of Berlin, Ernst Reuter,
    1951
     __________________________________________________________________

   People who go into exile leave a lot behind, especially if they have to
   escape quickly. In their families, often the only ones who can follow
   are direct relatives like husbands/wives and children; possessions and
   social networks are left behind. In the receiving country, everyday
   life is characterised by immigration bureaucracy, difficulties
   adjusting, financial worries and language problems. This results in
   uncertainties and uprooting, because lifestyle habits are eliminated
   and the new start is uncertain.

   Hundreds of thousands of people who went into exile between 1933 and
   1945 had to face these everyday struggles, including an estimated
   10,000 artists and scientists. They were cut off from the professional
   contacts that they had established over time and faced the challenge of
   finding adequate work. A large number of exiles were thus reliant on
   financial assistance from friends and acquaintances, benefactors and
   aid organisations. The reports from exiles repeatedly mention the
   inconvenience of having to ask acquaintances for money. In October
   1940, author Mascha Kaléko wrote in her New York diary that she and
   other emigrants had no money, no friends, no connections and no hope.
   They didn’t have the money for public transport, or even shoes. She
   also wrote that she did not have medication for her son Stephen and
   that he faced being thrown out of school because they could not afford
   the fees. “Damn money. It is humiliating not to have any” she
   complained and added that so-called friends were already avoiding her
   and her family as if they were lepers. (cited according to Gisela
   Zoch-Westphal: Aus den sechs Leben der Mascha Kaléko [From the 6 lives
   of Mascha Kaléko], p. 117f.)

   In some cases, the wives of emigrants took on simple work and poorly
   paid jobs to secure their families’ survival with their income, while
   their husbands tried to get their careers going in the receiving
   country. However, this situation also enabled many women in exile to
   overcome traditional gender roles and have successful careers.

   More than a few emigrants complained about loneliness because social
   contacts and friendships were at times hard to establish in the
   receiving country. For many, social life consisted only of contacts to
   other exiles. In part, the societies in the receiving countries were
   suspicious of and rejected the refugees. These are problems still faced
   by exiles and refugees who have had to leave their home countries.
   Prejudices against foreigners and racism often make it harder to start
   over in a new culture.

   In some countries, emigrants encountered favourable conditions: Many an
   architect managed to advance his career in the USA, Palestine or
   Turkey. In Mexico, communist artists found a liberal climate that was
   politically sympathetic to the Soviet Union for a while.

   For people leaving the GDR from 1949 onwards, the Federal Republic made
   it easier to organise everyday life in many ways. The post-War society
   in the Federal Republic offered them political freedom of expression
   and gave them the opportunity to succeed economically, and there was no
   language problem in the divided Germany. Public debate about cultural
   identity and integration also continued in Germany as a receiving
   country. However, differences between cultures that are brought along
   and which exist in the new place cannot be overcome by political
   programmes; they are an existential experience for those affected by
   them.

   1“Do we all belong to this country?” asks Nada Mustafa Ali in her book
   entitled: Gender, Race and Sudan’s Exile Politics. The title of the
   book is taken from a speech given in 1998 in Cairo by anthropologist
   Sharif Harir, the vice president of the Sudan Federal Democratic Party
   and member of the Sudan’s National Democratic Alliance’s executive
   office at that time, in which he discussed structural racism in the Old
   Sudan. While the issues of racism, gender and belonging have been at
   the centre of Sudanese politics in the Old Sudan, they were also key in
   the debates in 1990s and 2000s about the visions of the New Sudan, a
   term coined by John Garang in 1983. Although much less discussed in the
   book, Nada Ali’s research, however, is also relevant to issues of
   nation-building projects that both Sudans have faced since their
   separation in 2011. These concerns are even more relevant in the
   current situation in Sudan, with the regime change that took place in
   2019 due to the civil protests initiated in December 2018. Who belongs
   and how in the post-revolutionary Sudan is at the heart of the current
   debates about citizenship and rights in the country.

   2In eloquently written 6 chapters, the book discusses race relations
   and politics in Sudan starting from the 1950s till the separation in
   2011. Using gender and intersectional perspectives, Ali examines the
   discourses and practices of the Sudanese opposition in exile. The
   author carefully analyses the interplay between gender and race, and to
   a lesser extent social class and religion, as tenants shaping Sudanese
   identity and power relations. Through a historical perspective, Ali
   delves into the contemporary dynamics of women’s participation,
   discussions around women’s human rights, nationalism and gender
   equality in Sudan and in exile. She examines these questions looking
   closely at the opposition movements organised under the umbrella of the
   National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in exile in the 1990s and early
   2000s. She skillfully places these debates in a wider historical
   perspective of Sudanese politics which are developed in chapter 3,
   sketching out the interplay of colonialism, nationalism and Islamism
   and the way they have resulted in socioeconomic and political exclusion
   and resistance.

   3One of the main contributions of the book is its longitudinal
   research, and Nada Ali’s personal involvement in the opposition
   movement and exile politics since mid-1990s and her particular
   commitment to feminist coalition building among different Sudanese
   women’s groups. In the introductory chapter, she discusses her
   positionality and shows how her political choices influenced her
   research. She was also a strong proponent of the New Sudan vision,
   which she saw, as many at that time, as an emancipatory project that
   was concerned with racial/cultural and regional difference. This
   reflexive account about her positionality adds depth to her analysis
   and shows how her personal stands are intertwined with her research
   subjects. Based on multi-sited ethnographic, document review and
   discourse analysis research in Egypt, Kenya, and Eritrea between 1998
   and 1999, and on research of activisms in Sudan, South Sudan, and in
   the diaspora between 2010 and 2014, using feminist and intersectional
   analysis, the book shows how gender and race play key role in shaping
   contemporary political debates in Sudan and South Sudan. More
   importantly, these issues are also central to the ways women’s
   movements have been organising in the two countries since the mid
   1950s. They are also, as Ali demonstrates, the limits to the
   transnational coalition building centered on women’s issues in the two
   countries and in the diasporas.

   4The book is organized into 6 chapters followed by a conclusion and an
   epilogue. The introduction sets the scene and effectively introduces
   the key focus of the book, while providing an elegant grounding of the
   concepts in academic, especially feminist, writings on nationalism,
   gender and intersectionality, and nation-building projects. The book is
   firmly anchored in feminist theorisations of nationalism, with
   particular references to Nira Yuval-Davis’s work which clearly
   influenced Ali’s thinking, coalition building and the role of women’s
   movements in nation building. It provides rich interview material and
   in-depth analysis of documents and speeches, as well as author’s
   encounters with the different women’s groups and activists in exile.
   Ali provides detailed feminist and intersectional analysis of Sudanese
   women’s activisms throughout the 20^th century, with a careful
   examination of the activities of exiled Sudanese and South Sudanese
   women in the 1990s and 2000s. Chapter 4 examines in depth the gendered
   discourses and, and to a lesser extent, practices of the Sudanese
   opposition in exile. Chapter 5, on the other hand, focuses its analysis
   on the ways gender and race were intertwined in the emancipatory
   project of New Sudan. Ali shows also how this vision turned later into
   further oppression and marginalisation. Chapter 6 provides some
   insights into how women’s movements in Sudan and in South Sudan, as
   well as in the diasporas in Egypt and in Kenya, tried to resist further
   marginalisation and exclusion, yet their actions were not always
   successful. The coalition building proved difficult based on the deep
   racist and classist divisions.

   5The subject of the book is thematic given the current political
   changes in Sudan and the role women played in the uprising in 2019. The
   book clearly shows that despite difficult political situation and the
   constraints imposed on women in Sudan under the sharia law since the
   1980s, with more drastic regulations pertaining to personal freedoms
   linked to the Public Order act of 1999, women have also played an
   active role in Sudanese politics and strived to carve out a place for
   their activism. It is a compelling, well-written and insightful account
   of the politics of gender and race relations that underlie
   transnational coalition building among women’s groups. The book is a
   valuable contribution to the history of women’s movement in Sudan and
   in South Sudan, and the role of women in the nation building projects
   in the two countries.

   6Some of the shortcomings of the book are also acknowledged by the
   author. The vast of the research is focused among Northern Sudanese
   women activists, and the South Sudanese and other regional women’s
   groups are covered to a much lesser extent. The historical take on
   women’s activism in South Sudan, before the separation but also after,
   is tackled in a rather superficial way. Much more research is needed to
   show the historical diversities and regional particularities to women’s
   organising and women’s participation in nation-building processes in
   Sudan in general, and in South Sudan in particular. Nonetheless, the
   book offers important insights into the gendered politics of social
   movements, of nationalism, and deeply imbedded patriarchy in Sudan.
   While focused on particular case study, the book draws wider
   implications for understanding these phenomena worldwide.

   7The intersectional analysis with a particular focus on race is key to
   understand how gender and race are essential to make sense of social
   movements and social transformations. Social class and religion are
   important parameters, yet the book does not focus its analysis on them.
   Written by an engaged feminist academic, this book is a valuable read
   for academics, politicians and foremost activists committed to build a
   new Sudan, and more widely, inclusive and equal citizenship projects
   worldwide.

American Exile

   Rapid Deportations That Bypass the Courtroom

   American Exile Report

   American Exile Report

   The majority of people deported from the United States each year are
   never given a chance to have their claims heard in court. People denied
   of their due process rights include asylum seekers, children, people
   with mental disabilities, U.S. citizens, and people lawfully working in
   and visiting the United States. They already had rights or claims to
   stay in the United States — but that wasn't enough to protect them. For
   these individuals, their fates were decided by immigration enforcement
   officers, not judges.

   American Exile: Rapid Deportations That Bypass the Courtroom explains
   the underbelly of U.S. immigration policy through the stories of many
   people who had rights to be here or would be allowed to stay in the
   United States — if just given a chance. These are some of their
   stories.

   Yadira Felix with her grandmother Candelaria Felix

She was forced to leave behind the only life she knew — but she should have
been allowed to stay.

   Yadira Felix (pictured with her grandmother Candelaria Felix) was born
   in Mexico in 1988 and lived in the United States for 20 years. She has
   cognitive disabilities and graduated San Pasqual High School in
   California through a specialized program, making her eligible
   for deferred action for childhood arrivals (DACA). Yadira was waiting
   at a bus stop in California when Border Patrol agents approached and
   arrested her, drove her to the U.S.-Mexico border, and pushed her
   across to Mexico. Yadira was crying that she didn't want to go, but she
   wasn't even given the chance to call her family before being abandoned
   in Mexico. If Yadira had been given a hearing, she could have applied
   for relief under DACA.

   She was only allowed to return to her family in San Diego after the
   U.S. government settled an ACLU lawsuit on behalf of Yadira and many
   like her who were coerced and tricked into abandoning their rights and
   leaving the United States. This settlement is confined to Southern
   California, so there are others like Yadira who still remain in exile.

   Nydia

She was granted asylum, then deported back to her tormenters.

   Nydia, a transgender woman, was granted asylum in the United States
   after repeated physical and sexual attacks in Mexico. Her protected
   status didn't stop Border Patrol from twice deporting her to Mexico
   without a hearing despite verifiable evidence that she had asylum. Back
   in Mexico, Nydia was repeatedly attacked and raped, and then  kidnapped
   by a gang that trafficked her into the sex trade. She later
   successfully fled back to safety in the United States and applied for
   and was granted lawful permanent residence. "I didn't know the
   immigration agents could have helped me," Nydia said, recalling her
   previous attempts to enter the United States. "They had known all the
   reasons I was trying to come back to the U.S., and even knowing them,
   they sent me back."

   Soledad

She asked border officers for protection. Instead, she was prosecuted.

   Soledad fled two decades of physical and psychological abuse by her
   husband in Mexico after gangs had murdered two of her sons. She joined
   her remaining son in California, but after several years, she returned
   to Mexico to say farewell to the aunt who raised her. But her
   ex-husband found her and tried to murder her. Police told her they
   could do nothing to protect her, so she went back to the United
   States.But instead, border officers referred her for prosecution for
   illegal reentry.

   Soledad spent almost two years in detention, first for the criminal
   sentence and then in immigration detention, repeatedly asking for help
   before she was able to speak to an asylum officer. She won release on
   bond and her immigration case is ongoing.

A mother tricked into leaving her home.

   Isidora Lopez-Venegas is the mother of an autistic U.S. citizen son.
   She was arrested by Border Patrol and told — wrongly —that she could
   easily obtain legal status through her son once she was in Mexico. In
   fact, once outside the United States, she would have to wait
   approximately 10 years before returning home to California. But if she
   had seen an immigration judge, she could have presented her strong
   claims to stay. Instead Isidora, accompanied by her son, had to leave
   the United States. They were only able to return home after the ACLU
   filed a lawsuit.

2019 update: How long do refugees stay in exile? To find out, beware of
averages

   Number of refugees by years in exile

   "The average length of time that refugees spend in camps is 17 years."
   This cruel statistic has been quoted many times, influencing our
   perception of refugee crises as never-ending events which are spinning
   out of control. It has significant implications when deciding the type
   of aid that is needed, the combination of humanitarian and development
   support, and the possible responses to the crisis.

   But is it true? Not so.

   In fact, the "17 year" statistic comes from a 2004 internal UNHCR
   report, and it was accompanied by many caveats which have been lost
   along the way. The statistic does not refer to camps since the
   overwhelming majority of refugees live outside camps. It is limited to
   situations of five years or more, so it is an average duration of the
   longest situations, not of all situations. Most importantly, it refers
   to the duration of situations, not to the time people have stayed in
   exile.

   Take the situation of Somali refugees in Kenya. Refugees started to
   arrive massively around 1993, about 26 years ago. Their number now
   stands at 252,500. But can we say that all 252,500 have been in exile
   for 26 years?

   In fact, forced displacement situations are inherently dynamic: numbers
   vary every year, reflecting political and military developments in the
   country of origin  (figure 1). In fact, a large part of the current
   refugees did not arrive before 2008, i.e. about 10 years ago.
   Figure 1 Number of Somali refugees in Kenya (UNHCR data)
   Figure 1. Number of Somali refugees in Kenya (UNHCR data)

   Along these lines, and using data published by UNHCR as of end-2018, we
   re-calculated the earliest date at which various cohorts of refugees
   would have arrived in each situation (see our methodology as we
   developed it for this earlier working paper). We then aggregated all
   situations into a single "global refugee population" and calculated
   global averages and median durations.

   So what are the results?
   Figure 2 Global number of refugees by year of exile
   Figure 2. Global number of refugees by year of exile

   When we look at the "global refugee population" (see Figure 2), we can
   now distinguish several distinct episodes of displacement:

   Now let’s group these figures by largest waves of arrivals (Figure 3):
   Number of refugees by years in exile –Grouped by country
   Figure 3. Number of refugees by years in exile –Grouped by country

   There is a large cohort of about 8.5 million "recent refugees," who
   arrived over the last four years. This includes about 2.9 million
   Syrians, as well as people fleeing from South Sudan (1.7 million),
   Myanmar (0.7 million), Afghanistan (0.4 million), Burundi (0.3
   million), the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) (0.3 million), Iraq
   (.2 million), and the Central African Republic (0.2 million).

   Another large cohort, of about 6.4 million, has spent between 5 and 9
   years in exile. It includes refugees from Syria (3.6 million), South
   Sudan (0.6 million), the bulk of the current Somali refugees (0.3
   million), and people fleeing from Sudan (0.3 million), the Central
   African Republic (0.2 million), Afghanistan (0.2 million), and the
   Democratic Republic of Congo (0.2 million).

   About 3.2 million people have been in exile between 10 and 34 years.
   This includes years during which numbers are relatively low, and two
   episodes where they are higher, around 17 years ago, with the arrival
   of about 0.3 million Sudanese refugees, and around 27 years ago, with
   the arrival of about 0.5 million Somalis and 0.2 million Eritreans.

   Lastly, a large group of refugees has been in exile for 35 to 40 years:
   these 2.2 million refugees include mainly Afghans (1.9 million), but
   also about 0.3 million Vietnamese who fled their country during the
   late 1970s and early 1980s. Finally, there are few very protracted
   situations, up to 58 years, including mainly Western Sahara.

   We can now turn to average durations. As of end-2018, the median
   duration of exile stands at 5 years, i.e. half of the refugees
   worldwide have spent 5 years or less in exile. The median has
   fluctuated widely since the end of the Cold War, in 1991, between 4 and
   14 years. By contrast, the mean duration stands at 10.3 years, and has
   been relatively stable since the late 1990s, between 10 and 15 years.

   But this leads to another important finding: trends can be
   counter-intuitive. In fact, a decline in the average duration of exile
   is typically not an improvement, but rather the consequence of a
   degradation of the global situation . The averages increase in years
   when there are relatively few new refugees, and they drop when large
   numbers of people flow in, for example in 1993-1994 (with conflicts in
   Former Yugoslavia and Rwanda), in 1997-1999 (with conflicts in DRC and
   other parts of Africa), after 2003 (with conflict in Iraq, Somalia, and
   Sudan), and since 2013 (with the conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic).

   We also looked at the number of people who have spent more than five
   years in exile. As of end-2018, this number stands at 11.9 million. The
   number of protracted refugees had been remarkably stable since 1991 at
   5 to 7 million throughout most of the period, before dramatically
   jumping in the last 3 years.   For this group, the average duration of
   exile increases over time – largely because of the unresolved situation
   of Afghan refugees which pushes averages up. It is now well over 20
   years.

   This short analysis of UNHCR data shows that available refugee data can
   be used to clarify some important parts of the policy debate. It is
   important to ensure that this debate is informed by evidence , which
   can help provide a more nuanced perspective of a complex issue.

   "Finally, there are few very protracted situations, up to 58 years,
   including mainly Western Sahara"

   This sounds wrong to me, as the Western Sahara conflict only started in
   1975. I checked the UNHCR data and indeed Western Sahara refugees only
   enter the data 1975, but most in the 80s.

   It would be great for transparency if the World bank would publish the
   code for this sort of analysis.

   (Blog admin) Dear Euan, thanks for your interest. The methodology used
   is described in the working paper that Xavier mentions in the paragraph
   right after the first graphic, and it was developed three years ago,
   when he first performed a similar analysis:
   http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/549261472764700982/How-many-y
   … Please let us know here if this doesn't answer your question. Cheers.
   Euan Ritchie
   January 30, 2020

   Many thanks for responding. However this doesn't answer my question.
   The dataset that is referenced in the paper (UNHCR time series) does
   not contain any Western Saharan refugees that have been displaced since
   before 1975, and so it doesn't matter what the methodology is, the
   maximum possible average is 44 years.

   In fact using the methodology outlined in the paper to calculate
   average displacement time for Western Saharans in Mauritania and
   Algeria (which accounts for >gt;99%) I get an average of 34 years. (Happy
   to share my calculations)

   I don't have a particular concern with WS. But the implication in the
   paragraph I referred to is that Western Saharans have been displaced
   for longer than they possibly could have been, and this makes me
   question the accuracy of numbers. Which is why I think it would be
   useful to see the code.
   January 31, 2020

   Dear Euan, first off apologies for the delay in publishing your second
   comment. You are right: We contacted the authors and they are grateful
   for your noticing the mix-up. The situation that lasted for 58 years
   actually corresponds to Rwanda and not Western Sahara (which indeed
   started in 1975). Codes are available upon request to the authors
   ([email protected]; [email protected])
   Thanks so much for your interest and for contacting us.

   Jack Woodruff

   Good data, but still searching for what is perhaps the most relevant
   statistic here:

   "Of refugees who have been successfully resettled, what was THEIR wait
   time distribution?

   This statistic would isolate away the problem of new refugees dragging
   down the average length of time as a refugee.

   It has been described as Afghanistan’s brain drain, after the Taliban’s
   return to power last year precipitated an exodus of politicians,
   academics and journalists who fled in anticipation of reprisals and
   censorship under the militant group’s draconian regime.

   For a small group of Afghan women, however, the work of running the
   country has not stopped, even in exile.

   Fawzia Koofi is a former member of Afghanistan’s parliament and was its
   first female deputy speaker. Despite moving several times since leaving
   the country in August last year, the 47-year-old has kept talking with
   her former colleagues and contacts in international governance, working
   to find solutions to the political and humanitarian crisis in
   Afghanistan.

   “They [the Taliban] don’t know how to govern and they don’t respect the
   social mosaic of Afghanistan, which makes them more fragile, but is
   also hurting Afghans,” says Koofi, who has been working in Europe and
   the US with member states across the UN for the past year. “I don’t
   believe they will last very long, but I am concerned over the damage
   they inflict on Afghanistan’s social and political fabric.”

   The work of Koofi and fellow Afghan women has helped to fill the gulf
   that exists between the Taliban, which are operating under severe
   sanctions and are domestically consumed with an economic crisis and
   enforcing gender apartheid, and the international community.

   “We call them the ‘group of six’,” says Sarah Douglas, of UN Women,
   referring to a core group of Afghan women who have been instrumental in
   steering international policy towards their country over the past year.
   The group also includes Asila Wardak, a former diplomat and one of the
   founders of the Afghan Women’s Network; Sofia Ramyar, the former
   executive director of the youth-led organisation Afghans for
   Progressive Thinking; and the journalist Anisa Shaheed.

   Giving an example, Douglas says: “There were negotiations around the
   mandate renewal of the UN assistance mission in Afghanistan (Unama) –
   and concerns that the mandate would regress in terms of gender equality
   and human rights, and that this would be reflected in the budget. But
   the mandate remained intact, and central member states actually reached
   out to me and said that the advocacy by these women really made a
   difference in those negotiations.”

   and Development Studies

   Mariken Bruusgaard Harbitz, part of the permanent mission of Norway to
   the UN, says: “Norway initiated closed-door dialogues for these women
   to present their priorities to key member states at a critical time.
   During the process of renewing Unama’s mandate, these women came with
   clear expectations to the wording of the mandate, which in turn
   contributed to a strong monitoring and reporting mechanism for Unama on
   the ground.”

   Mariam Safi, director of the Afghan Organisation for Policy Research
   and Development Studies, has not allowed the chaos and shock of the
   last year to stop her continuing her work from Canada, collecting
   crucial data from Afghanistan, specifically from women. After a brief
   hiatus, Safi improvised and restarted her work a few months ago through
   a digital platform, with female researchers across Canada and
   Afghanistan working from home.

   One of their key projects, called Bishnaw, which means “listen” in
   Dari, continues to hold surveys with women across Afghanistan. “There’s
   a narrative [in the media] right now that says Afghans are
   predominantly concerned with the humanitarian crisis,” says Safi. “But
   our data from women across nine provinces shows that right after that,
   women are most concerned about women’s rights and closure of girls’
   schools.”

   Bishnaw’s surveys have also revealed a pattern of women being excluded
   from receiving international aid. “Of about 295 women, 163 told us that
   no women in their household had access to aid, contrary to the Taliban
   claims that women-led households were being provided aid. Only about
   five women out of 532 surveyed said all women have access at all.”

   “Such data can actually provide [the international community] with a
   lot more leverage in their discussions with the Taliban,” she says. “In
   every meeting they are always asking, ‘What do Afghans want? What do
   women want? What are their concerns?’ We want to be able to provide
   data to answer those questions,” she says.

   Naheed Farid, one of the youngest Afghan parliamentarians when she was
   elected at 27, describes her work with the group of six as reviving her
   sense of mission after she left Kabul for the US last year. “I had lost
   all hope after the Taliban takeover. But watching Afghan women and
   youth marching across Kabul, Herat, Mazar-i-Sharif and Jalalabad
   demanding for their rights gave me the strength to reignite my
   advocacy,” she says.

   Douglas says there is a danger of international focus drifting away
   from Afghanistan without the efforts of these women and others like
   them. “My assessment is that they are being extremely bold because they
   want to keep the momentum and the visibility, and the issue of Afghan
   women, high on the agenda. And especially with the situation in
   Ukraine, they’re very concerned that the international community is
   forgetting about that.”

   One member state whom she highlights for their continued commitment to
   working with the group is Ireland. Their outgoing ambassador to the UN,
   Geraldine Byrne Nason, says: “With my team, I meet with them on roughly
   a monthly basis. We cover the latest developments in Afghanistan as
   they affect ordinary people, and women in particular. I keep them
   abreast of developments at the UN and in particular, at the security
   council. I seek their views on the issues of the day as they relate to
   the council’s work on Afghanistan. We exchange views on how to use our
   respective leverage to make a difference.”

   “Discussions of and decisions on peace and security in a conference
   room in midtown Manhattan can only be effective if they are informed by
   the voices of those directly impacted,” says Byrne.

   The Tsamba family lost nearly 20 sheep over two cold winter days in
   2011. They live on the edge in Mongolia's Arkhangai Province,
   struggling through harsh winters alongside their herd of sheep. Severe
   winter conditions, known as dzud, have been responsible for the deaths
   of half the family's once 2,000-strong herd over the past three
   winters.

Exiled by the Environment

   In the winter of 2009-10, Mongolia’s characteristically harsh climate
   became too much even for its native animals. About eight million cattle
   died, and the country experienced what could be described as a crash in
   the livestock market. Thousands of herders lost everything.

   been responsible for the deaths of half the family's once 2,000-strong
   herd of sheep over the past three winters. Recently, in search of
   warmer pastures, the Tsambas moved from Bulgan province in the north to
   this region near a central Mongolian village called Ulziit.

   When photographer Alessandro Grassani read about that devastating
   winter, now known as the White Death, he decided that the story of
   people affected by extreme and unpredictable weather was too common to
   go unexamined. On a trip to Mongolia he documented the “before and
   after”—people struggling to stick it out in rural areas and people who
   had already lost everything and fled to the capital, Ulaanbaatar, where
   almost half of 1.3 million residents live in crowded, informal
   settlements.

   capital's population has doubled in the past two years, expanding
   outward in a haphazard sprawl, and many inhabitants live in slums known
   as the "Gher district." High levels of unemployment and poverty await
   herders who abandon rural areas and arrive in the city, untrained in
   any skills necessary for urban jobs.

   Sharing the plight of environmental migrants—people who have to flee
   their land because of dramatic and devastating changes in the
   environment—became an obsession for Grassani. He traveled on to
   Bangladesh, Kenya, and Haiti, each a country dealing with a unique
   climate crisis, each with a group of people cast off of their land,
   away from their traditions, and into crowded urban centers.

   death, his skull is all that's left of his body, which was eaten by
   wild animals. The insufficient and arid grazing land is the reason
   behind fighting between shepherds of Kenya’s Keniota tribe and
   Ethiopia’s Marille tribe.

   Lake Azuei (and the neighbouring Lake Enquirillo in the Dominican
   Republic) is unprecedented. The size of the lake has almost doubled in
   the last 10 years, destroying and submerging homes and farms. Ghostly
   trunks of dead palm trees are all that remains.

   In Mongolia, it’s extreme cold. In Bangladesh and Haiti, it’s floods
   and rising sea levels, in Kenya desertification and tribal clashes over
   the control of water. These situations cast people out of a newly
   uninhabitable countryside and into poor living conditions in the
   “booming slums” of capital cities, which Grassani calls “ground zero
   for environmental migrants today.”

   Drought caused Sharon's harvest of fruits and vegetables to decrease
   year after year. Eventually she was forced to abandon her village and
   move into an iron hut in Kibera, Nairobi's largest slum, with her two
   children.

   This isn’t an issue that’s going to go away. The International
   Migration Organization says that most studies estimate there will be
   200 million people in this situation by 2050. While environmental
   migrants aren’t recognized by international law like refugees of war,
   Grassani, who has photographed both war and climate change, draws
   parallels between the issues:

   “Man is responsible for both of them. In both cases people suffer
   because they lose their villages, their lands, and their families. It
   doesn’t matter if it is a bomb which destroys and kills your family or
   if it is a hurricane, flood, or drought that force you off your land
   and kill your child because there is no water to drink and nothing to
   eat. The only difference is that we can’t fight against nature—we have
   already lost this war if we don’t react very soon.”

   Due to the growing demand for sand used in construction in Port au
   Prince and other Haitian cities, mines are abundant. Land exploitation,
   together with the soil erosion and deforestation endemic in Haiti, make
   the country very vulnerable to the effects of climate change and
   extreme weather events.

   Grassani doesn’t believe the climate migrants he’s met will be able to
   return to their homes. The places he’s working in, he says, “don’t have
   the resources to invest in alternative development policies in the
   areas hit by climate change.”

   But despite dismal projections, he continues exploring these tragedies,
   and, like a visual prophet, sharing them with the world in the hopes
   that people will see and react. After all, he has a daughter who is
   almost two years old. “I often think about what the world will be like
   when she becomes an adult, and of course I worry about it,” he says.
   “This project is my own contribution to our society. This is my
   reaction. This is what I am able to do to awaken consciences.”

   BBC Journalist Says he has Left Russia for British Exile

   MOSCOW —

   An investigative journalist for the BBC's Russian-language service in
   Moscow said in a video released on Monday that he had felt compelled to
   leave Russia for self-imposed exile in Britain due to what he called
   unprecedented surveillance.

   Russian authorities designated Andrei Zakharov a "foreign agent" in
   October, a decision the British broadcaster said at the time it
   strongly rejected and would try to overturn.

   The designation was the latest twist in a crackdown on media outlets
   that the authorities in Moscow see as hostile and foreign-backed.
   Separately, BBC journalist Sarah Rainsford left Russia in August after
   Moscow refused to extend her permission to work in what it said was a
   tit-for-tat row with Britain over the treatment of foreign media.

   The foreign agent designation has Cold War-era connotations and
   requires those so labelled to prominently indicate in all their content
   that they are "foreign agents," something which can hurt advertising
   revenue.

   Zakharov said in the video posted from London on YouTube that he had
   felt compelled to leave Russia after noticing what he called
   "unprecedented surveillance" of his activities in Moscow.

   He did not say who was watching him and added he wasn't sure if he was
   being followed because of his foreign agent designation or because of a
   recent investigation he had carried out into alleged Russian hackers.

   The Russian interior ministry did not immediately respond to a request
   for comment on the video.

   The Kremlin has repeatedly said that journalists and media outlets
   designated as foreign agents can continue their work in Russia.

   The BBC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the
   remarks from Zakharov, who has investigated topics ranging from
   President Vladimir Putin's personal history to Russian disinformation
   factories.

   exile

about us

   Due to war, racial, ethnic, sexual and gender discrimination, or
   religious, economic and political marginalization, every day many
   people are forced to leave their homeland. Amongst them, some are
   artists often involved in a continuous fight against the authorities of
   their countries. Since it is the duty of art to be the voice of the
   oppressed and to reveal the underlying issues in the society, the
   creative sector in Europe must be particularly mindful of the matter
   and provide
   the infrastructures to better accommodate these artists. Artists must
   be able to continue to practice their art, not only as individuals, but
   also as custodians of their culture. It is through art that the culture
   of a people whose autonomy is threatened, will continue to live on.

   The mission of the agency of artists in exile (aa-e) is to identify
   artists in exile of all origins and disciplines, to support them
   according to their situation and needs, to offer them work space and to
   put them in contact with professionals (French and European networks),
   in order to provide them with the necessary means to restructure and
   continue their practice. According to the demands of project and
   programs, the aa-e creates its own events, including the “Party in
   exile” and the multidisciplinary festival, Visions of Exile, in
   cooperation with its partners.

our mission

       computers with internet access, meet in small numbers and arrange
       appointments;
     * spaces for artistic practice where artists can come to work
       occasionally or in the form of residencies punctuated by
       presentations by professionals, or workshops on artistic practice
       for an amateur public.

At last moment, BBC drops documentary on Jewish exile

Filmmaker Ilan Ziv says move stems from incompetence, naivete, political
pressure and ‘lack of courage’

   A last-minute decision by the BBC to drop a documentary that questions
   the extent of the Jewish exile after the Roman destruction of Jerusalem
   in 70 CE was a mixture of “incompetence,” “political naiveté” and “lack
   of courage,” the Israeli filmmaker behind the project has charged.

   The film “Exile: A Myth Unearthed,” which theorizes that many
   modern-day Palestinians could be partially descended from Jews who
   never left the region, was due to be shown in modified form by the BBC
   last week, but was pulled from the schedule at the last moment.
   Director Ilan Ziv has denied that the film aims to delegitimize Israel
   by claiming that the accepted historical narrative of Jewish history is
   false.

   According to publicity material for the film, it “looks at new evidence
   that suggests the majority of the Jewish people may not have been
   exiled following the fall of Jerusalem in 70 AD. Travelling from
   Galilee to Jerusalem and the catacombs of Rome, the film asks us to
   rethink our ideas about an event that has played a critical role in the
   Christian and Jewish traditions.”

   In a lengthy blog post, Ziv wrote that he had been in discussions with
   the BBC since late last year about the project, after the network
   proposed airing an edited version of the documentary. According to Ziv,
   he discovered only recently that the BBC, in conjunction with the
   National Film Board of Canada (which co-sponsored the film), also
   intended to give the film a different title — “Jerusalem: an
   Archaeological Mystery Story” — and possibly remove his name entirely
   from the credits, in order to recast it as an adaptation.

   Ziv said that he had been given a cut of the film only three days
   before the planned air date, but then the BBC officially pulled the
   project, saying that it “doesn’t fit editorially” and that it was
   “under review.”

   He also alleged BBC sources had said a freelance editor hired to re-cut
   the film called it “propaganda.”

   The episode was “a sad story,” Ziv said, noting that he believed BBC
   executives had been fully aware of the film’s potentially controversial
   nature when they acquired it, and hoped to “sneak it in” by changing
   its title. When they were “caught,” he alleged, they panicked and
   dropped the project completely instead of fighting for it.

   “This is ultimately a sad saga of what I believe is a mixture of
   incompetence, political naiveté, conscious or subconscious political
   pressure and ultimately, I believe, a lack of courage of broadcasters
   when they are faced with the complexity of the Middle East issue and
   the intense emotions, fears and aggression it generates,” Ziv wrote.

   He said that he would “show the film publicly throughout the UK and…
   challenge the BBC to either broadcast the film or relinquish its
   rights.”
   Israeli politics told straight

   I joined The Times of Israel after many years covering US and Israeli
   politics for Hebrew news outlets.

   I believe responsible coverage of Israeli politicians means presenting
   a 360 degree view of their words and deeds – not only conveying what
   occurs, but also what that means in the broader context of Israeli
   society and the region.

   That’s hard to do because you can rarely take politicians at face value
   – you must go the extra mile to present full context and try to
   overcome your own biases.

   I’m proud of our work that tells the story of Israeli politics straight
   and comprehensively. I believe Israel is stronger and more democratic
   when professional journalists do that tough job well.

   Your support for our work by joining The Times of Israel Community
   helps ensure we can continue to do so.

Libyan exile’s life captured vividly on film

   The recently released documentary The Colonel’s Stray Dogs provides a
   political and personal perspective of Libya under the rule of the late
   Muammar Gaddafi.

   Undated: A still image from director Khalid Shamis’ latest documentary,
   The Colonel’s Stray Dogs, showing him and his father Ashur Shamis going
   through top secret files unearthed in Ashur's study at home in London.

   In his first feature-length documentary released in 2011, The Imam and
   I, Cape Town-based filmmaker Khalid Shamis, 46, told the story of his
   maternal grandfather Imam Abdullah Haron. A prominent anti-apartheid
   activist and cleric, the imam was murdered by the South African
   Police’s notorious Security Branch while in detention.

   The filmmaker’s next venture is a similar ode to a family political
   drama, but this time it is about his father, the political activist and
   journalist Ashur Shamis, 72. Its title, The Colonel’s Stray Dogs, is
   taken from a statement by Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 1980 giving
   orders to eliminate all the country’s “stray dogs” – exiles living
   abroad – and telling them to either return or face “physical
   liquidation”.

   Shamis’ father was one of these so-called stray dogs, and the
   documentary provides a deeply personal window into the tragedy of Libya
   by interrogating his life-long sacrifice against the backdrop of his
   life, and that of his family, in exile. It is being screened at the
   Durban International Film Festival until 1 August.

   about his father, piecing together parts of his story through archival
   materials. (Photograph by Tiago Correia-Paulo)

   While deeply political, the story is also profoundly personal. Shamis’
   central question is about his father’s commitment to his family versus
   his dedication to the struggle for freedom, and the cost of that. “My
   dad opposed Gaddafi for most of his life,” Shamis says in the film’s
   opening lines. “For the 40 years he was in exile in England, it felt
   like killing Gaddafi was more important to him than living with us.”

   Through a decade of research, laboriously digging through archives and
   doing interviews, he stitches together a remarkable story. His part in
   it starts in London in the United Kingdom, where he was born to his
   Libyan father and South African mother Shamela, who had left her home
   country when she was 18, escaping the apartheid regime who would kill
   her father a year later. The couple met, married and started a family.

   Shamis says his youth was relatively normal considering the
   extraordinary circumstances of his parents’ background. About Libya, he
   says, he was “always curious and a bit intrepid”. In London the family
   always discussed Cape Town, he explains, whereas “Libya was always this
   unknowable place. It was very closed, and it was all about the cult of
   Gaddafi.”

   Shamis left London for South Africa in 2005 to make The Imam and I. He
   ended up staying, raising his own family.

Tracing history

   Gaddafi rose to power in the late 1960s through a military coup in
   Libya and ruled for 40 years until his death. Ashur had become
   politicised during the 1960s while still living in Libya, but left for
   London in 1965 to pursue his studies as an aeronautical engineer. Owing
   to his criticism of the government, Ashur’s name was added to a target
   list in the early 1970s and he was unable to return to home.

   Many Libyan political dissidents were forced abroad at the time. Ashur
   hid his political life from his family in order to protect them. At one
   point, he was declared an enemy of the Libyan state with a $1 million
   bounty on his head. Meanwhile, he predominantly worked to promote the
   resistance movement abroad and became central as a media liaison and,
   later, a journalist working for the BBC World Service.

   While in exile, Ashur joined members of the London-based National Front
   for the Salvation of Libya (NFSL), which was formed in 1981 with the
   core focus of creating a democratic Islamic society. Its members
   conducted a series of military actions in the 1980s against Gaddafi,
   including a failed coup attempt. Though the NFSL was the core
   opposition to Gaddafi’s regime, it is known to have had ties to
   America’s Central Intelligence Agency in maintaining its covert
   operations abroad.

   years, he was shown on television in silhouette as he was targeted by
   Muammar Gaddafi’s regime. (Images courtesy of Khalid Shamis)

   Some of Shamis’ earliest memories of his father are seeing his
   silhouetted figure appearing on the evening television news. Ashur
   became a political commentator on news from Libya but his face was
   always hidden. He had several near-fatal experiences as he covertly
   tried to spur on the revolution.

   Shamis says he did not know much about his father’s activities. “I knew
   my dad was in opposition to Gaddafi. I knew that he was on [an]
   Interpol [list] – at one point there was a bounty on his head. I knew
   growing up that he had all these passports, I’d seen them. But the
   details I didn’t know… What opened this up for me was realising he had
   all of these documents under his desk, in suitcases.”

   The full extent of Ashur’s involvement in the NFSL only unfolded for
   Shamis through making the film. It is summed up humorously when he says
   to his father: “While we were in the other room watching Rambo, you
   were in this room planning Rambo.”

A stranger in his country

   Gaddafi’s fall from grace was a messy one. It was not only Libyan
   rebels and youths who joined forces to end his regime. A North Atlantic
   Treaty Organization intervention that was widely criticised lasted
   seven months and raised a death toll of about 8 000 people.

   When Gaddafi’s rule came to a bloody end in 2011, Shamis mainly wanted
   to document his father’s return home after 40 years. “When the
   revolution started, I thought if there’s a chance my dad’s going to go
   back, I want to make a film about it. I knew the main points of the
   history. I wanted to know more about what he did and to see what
   happens when he goes back.”

   But he came to realise that he would have to explore both the
   relationship between Ashur and the dictator and that between father and
   son, and so he would have to feature in it too. “And from that point I
   thought okay, it has to really be me in it. I have to not just tell his
   story but tell my story of his story.”
   Undated: Father and son Ashur and Khalid Shamis together in a still
   from The Colonel’s Stray Dogs. They spent many years sifting through
   suitcases full of documents that carry nearly 40 years of Libyan
   political history.

   Ashur left for Libya as an adviser to the government once Gaddafi was
   chased out of Tripoli only to find it a vastly different place to the
   one he had left. Shamis and the rest of the family visited a few months
   later. “By the time we arrived in Libya, Gaddafi was dead and it was a
   new place,” he says of the country he had heard about his entire life
   but visited only once.

   The revolution once imagined did not happen and the freedom dreams held
   for Libya were not actualised. The country was deeply fractured, many
   returning exiles were marginalised and the government continued to
   remain unstable – a situation that remains to this day and is often
   referred to as the “Libyan crisis”. Ashur, despondent and unable to
   find himself a place among the new ideals of Libya, chose to return to
   London, where he continues to live.

Building blocks

   The Colonel’s Stray Dogs has an excellent score by Shamis’ close
   friend, the film producer and composer Tiago Correia-Paulo. But much of
   its brilliance lies in the selection of powerful archival material – an
   impressive array of cassettes, VHS tapes, secret documents, passports,
   letters, books, photos and combat footage from Libya – all of which had
   been preserved by Ashur.

   “Anything to do with Libya, he recorded it,” says Shamis. “Or anything
   to do with what’s been happening in the Middle East, such as the
   Iranian Revolution. He’s got old tape recorders and newspapers… He
   would send us out to get all the newspapers. He would cut them up.”
   Circa 1984: Ashur Shamis, his wife Shamela and their sons during a
   family dinner at a restaurant in London.

   Shamis would often be the one to press “record” on the tapes. “Whenever
   anything happened with Libya, my dad was the go-to guy,” he says. “He
   would go for the interview and he’d call us on those phones with the
   curly wire and say, ‘Khalid, at 10 o’clock tonight, press record on the
   VHS machine. Find the tape, put it in and just record.”

   The first thing Shamis did when starting work on the film was to gather
   all the material and digitise what would become his main source for
   constructing the story. “The archives is a big thing,” he says, and it
   was an arduous and expensive process to obtain the rights for using
   some of the material.

A personal take

   Gaddafi was a complex and divisive figure – some thought of him as a
   dictator and renegade madman, whereas others saw him as a
   pan-Africanist and anti-imperialist who supported the liberation
   movements of many African countries. But as Shamis says: “He wasn’t
   that to us. He tried to kill us.”

   He adds: “On the one hand, he was the new handsome face of the
   socialist Left, but he became this dictator to his own people. He
   talked about wanting to unite Africa, but he wanted to rule Africa as
   well.”

   Two months after Gaddafi’s announcement about capturing “stray dogs”,
   Libyan agents shot dead BBC journalist Mohammed Mustafa Ramadan, a
   friend of Ashur’s, outside the Regent’s Park mosque in London. “There
   are Libyan families we grew up with whose dads were assassinated,” says
   Shamis, “and they suffered. But we survived and we kept together. And
   my dad’s alive. I think I should have talked about them more somehow
   [in the film], but it’s also not my story to tell.”
   Circa 1982: Old photographs of Ashur Shamis that were taken at the
   height of the National Front for the Salvation of Libya’s operations in
   London.

   Having two activist paternal figures has influenced Shamis to use his
   filmmaking as a medium for deeply personal takes on political art. Both
   his documentaries have revealed important moments in history that were
   previously undocumented, especially from the unique perspective of
   exile.

   To his credit as a filmmaker, Shamis is able to convey the story from
   within, without missing a beat. He has captured the family’s life in
   London, sometimes approaching the interviews more as an investigative
   journalist than a son, unafraid to ask both his parents difficult
   questions. Particularly interesting is the interview with Shamela, an
   incredibly strong woman and, as the daughter of Imam Haron and Ashur’s
   wife, the holder of many secrets.

   Initially, there is a distance between father and son as the interviews
   take place, but their relationship changes as the film progresses.
   “That’s what I got out of it,” says Shamis. “I think, knowing what he
   gave up and sacrificed and what he was going towards, I never really
   questioned before what that was.”

   Shamis says as the making of The Colonel’s Stray Dogs progressed, his
   father would often refer to it as “our film” and ask fondly: “How’s our
   film coming along?” He regrets not being able to watch its premiere at
   the Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival in April with
   Ashur, owing to Covid-19 travel restrictions. “My big dream was to be
   in the cinema and watch it with him, but it didn’t happen.” When his
   father did get to see the film, “he didn’t expect this personal story,
   but it got his stamp of approval”.
   Undated: A still image from The Colonel’s Stray Dogs showing fragments
   of a double life. Ashur Shamis carried multiple passports and had
   different code names in order to remain underground and protect his
   family.

   Wrapping the film in March after so many years of working on it was a
   “great feeling”, says Shamis. “I was ready to let it go. It’s a big
   weight off your shoulders, because over these years it’s always
   there.”

   Shamis’ unconventional approach to telling his father’s story paints a
   fragile journey in heroic mode. Ultimately, it is a tragic story about
   the dream for freedom and its personal costs – one to which many exiles
   around the world can relate.
