Zelenskyy and Ukraine's survival – it may be time to consider a government in
exile

Zelenskyy faces a dramatic stay-or-leave decision as the Russian army

   As Russian forces solidify their stranglehold on Kyiv, President
   Volodymyr Zelenskyy must be prepared to stand up a government in exile
   if the capital falls.

   No one faulted Charles de Gaulle when he established a government in

   A government in exile will help ensure that Ukraine maintains its

   Setting up a government-in-exile for a country of more than 40 million
   people is no small feat. Beyond providing diplomatic support and
   defensive weaponry to Ukraine, the United States should be prepared to
   assist a government in exile with immediate assistance -- computers,
   secure communications, office equipment and security -- wherever
   Zelenskyy directs his government to set up camp.

   Whatever his decision, President Zelenskyy has already left his mark on
   history with his exemplary courage. By setting up a government in
   exile, he will help to ensure his country’s future.

Exile

   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
   Jump to navigation Jump to search
   Event by which a person is forced away from home
   For other uses, see Exile (disambiguation).
   Napoleon's Exile on Saint Helena by Franz Josef Sandman (1820)
   The First Night in Exile – This painting comes from a celebrated series
   illustrating one of Hinduism's great epics, the Ramayana. It tells the
   story of prince Rama, who is wrongly exiled from his father's kingdom,
   accompanied only by his wife and brother.
   Dante in Exile by Domenico Petarlini [es]

   Exile is primarily penal expulsion from one's native country, and
   secondarily expatriation or prolonged absence from one's homeland under
   either the compulsion of circumstance or the rigors of some high
   purpose. Usually persons and peoples suffer exile, but sometimes social
   entities like institutions (e.g. the papacy or a government) are forced
   from their homeland.

   In Roman law, exsilium denoted both voluntary exile and banishment as a
   capital punishment alternative to death. Deportation was forced exile,
   and entailed the lifelong loss of citizenship and property. Relegation
   was a milder form of deportation, which preserved the subject's
   citizenship and property.^[1]

   The term diaspora describes group exile, both voluntary and forced.
   "Government in exile" describes a government of a country that has
   relocated and argues its legitimacy from outside that country.
   Voluntary exile is often depicted as a form of protest by the person
   who claims it, to avoid persecution and prosecution (such as tax or
   criminal allegations), an act of shame or repentance, or isolating

For Inanimate Objects[edit]

   Ivan the Terrible once exiled to Siberia an inanimate object -- a
   bell.^[2] "When the inhabitants of the town of Uglich rang their bell
   to rally a demonstration against Ivan the Terrible, the cruel Czar
   executed two hundred (nobles), and exiled the Uglich bell to Siberia,
   where it remained for two hundred years."^[3]

Exiled heads of state[edit]

   Main article: List of heads of state or government who have been in
   exile

   In some cases the deposed head of state is allowed to go into exile
   following a coup or other change of government, allowing a more
   peaceful transition to take place or to escape justice.^[4]
--
Avoiding tax or legal matters[edit]

   Main articles: Tax exile and Fugitive

   A wealthy citizen who moves to a jurisdiction with lower taxes is
   termed a tax exile. Creative people such as authors and musicians who
   achieve sudden wealth sometimes choose this. Examples include the
   British-Canadian writer Arthur Hailey, who moved to the Bahamas to
--
   before the government could seize their assets. Members of the band all
   moved to France for a period of time where they recorded music for the
   album that came to be called Exile on Main Street, the Main Street of
   the title referring to the French Riviera.^[6] In 2012, Eduardo
   Saverin, one of the founders of Facebook, made headlines by renouncing
--
   Brazilian/U.S. citizen's decision to move to Singapore and renounce his
   citizenship spurred a bill in the U.S. Senate, the Ex-PATRIOT Act,
   which would have forced such wealthy tax exiles to pay a special tax in
   order to re-enter the United States.^[8]

   In some cases a person voluntarily lives in exile to avoid legal
   issues, such as litigation or criminal prosecution. An example of this
   is Asil Nadir, who fled to the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus for

   Examples include:
     * Iraqi academics asked to return home "from exile" to help rebuild
       Iraq in 2009^[9]
     * Jews who fled persecution from Nazi Germany^[10]
     * People undertaking a religious or civil liberties role in society
       may be forced into exile due to threat of persecution. For example,
       nuns were exiled following the Communist coup d'état of 1948 in
       Czechoslovakia.^[11]

Euphemism for convict[edit]

   Exile, government man and assigned servant were all euphemisms used in
   the 19th century for convicts under sentence who had been transported
   from Britain to Australia.^[12]
--
For groups, nations and governments[edit]

Comfortable exile[edit]

   Main articles: Social alienation and Identity (social science)

   Comfortable exile is an alternative theory recently developed by
   anthropologist Binesh Balan in 2018. According to him, comfortable
   exile is a "social exile of people who have been excluded from the
   mainstream society. Such people are considered 'aliens' or internal
   'others' on the grounds of their religious, racial, ethnic, linguistic
--
   religion, society or culture."^[13]

Nation in exile[edit]

   Main articles: Diaspora and Refugee

   When a large group, or occasionally a whole people or nation is exiled,
   it can be said that this nation is in exile, or "diaspora". Nations
   that have been in exile for substantial periods include the Jews, who
   were deported by Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar II in 586 BC and again
   following the destruction of the second Temple in Jerusalem in AD 70.
--
   the uprisings (like Kościuszko Uprising, November Uprising and January
   Uprising) against the partitioning powers (Russia, Prussia and
   Austria), many Poles have chosen – or been forced – to go into exile,
   forming large diasporas (known as Polonia), especially in France and
   the United States.^[15] The entire population of Crimean Tatars
   (numbering 200,000 in all) that remained in their homeland of Crimea
   was exiled on 18 May 1944 to Central Asia as a form of ethnic cleansing
   and collective punishment on false accusations.^[16]

   Since the Cuban Revolution, over a million Cubans have left Cuba. Most
   of these self-identified as exiles as their motivation for leaving the
   island is political in nature. At the time of the Cuban Revolution,
   Cuba only had a population of 6.5 million, and was not a country that
   had a history of significant emigration, it being the sixth largest
   recipient of immigrants in the world as of 1958. Most of the exiles'
   children also consider themselves to be Cuban exiles. Under Cuban law,
   children of Cubans born abroad are considered Cuban citizens.^[17]

  Government in exile[edit]

   Main article: Government in exile

   During a foreign occupation or after a coup d'état, a government in
   exile of a such afflicted country may be established abroad. One of the
   most well-known instances of this is the Polish government-in-exile, a
   government in exile that commanded Polish armed forces operating
   outside Poland after German occupation during World War II. Other
   examples include the Free French Forces government of Charles de Gaulle
   of the same time, and the Central Tibetan Administration, commonly
   known as the Tibetan government-in-exile, and headed by the 14th Dalai
   Lama.

  Literature[edit]

   In ancient Rome, the Roman Senate had the power to declare the exile to
   individuals, families or even entire regions. One of the Roman victims
   was the poet Ovid, who lived during the reign of Augustus. He was
   forced to leave Rome and move away to the city of Tomis on the Black
   Sea, now Constanta. There he wrote his famous work Tristia (Sorrows)
   about his bitter feelings in exile.^[20] Another, at least in a
   temporary exile, was Dante.

   The German-language writer Franz Kafka described the exile of Karl
   Rossmann in the posthumously published novel Amerika.^[21]

   During the period of National Socialism in the first few years after
   1933, many Jews, as well as a significant number of German artists and
   intellectuals fled into exile; for instance, the authors Klaus Mann and
   Anna Seghers. So Germany's own exile literature emerged and received
   worldwide credit.^[22] Klaus Mann finished his novel Der Vulkan [de]
   (The Volcano. A Novel Among Emigrants) in 1939^[23] describing the
   German exile scene, "to bring the rich, scattered and murky experience
   of exile into epic form",^[24] as he wrote in his literary balance
   sheet. At the same place and in the same year, Anna Seghers published
   her famous novel Das siebte Kreuz (The Seventh Cross, published in the
   United States in 1942).

   Important exile literatures in recent years include that of the
   Caribbean, many of whose artists emigrated to Europe or the United
   States for political or economic reasons. These writers include Nobel

   offered to step down in favor of his son. When this offer was rejected,
   he abdicated and was sent to Elba. In March 1815, he escaped his island
   exile and returned to Paris, where he regained supporters and reclaimed
   his emperor title, Napoleon I, in a period known as the Hundred Days.
   However, in June 1815, he was defeated at the bloody Battle of
   Waterloo. Napoleon’s defeat ultimately signaled the end of France’s
   domination of Europe. He abdicated for a second time and was exiled to
   the remote island of Saint Helena, in the southern Atlantic Ocean,

Forced to flee: A timeline of journalists’ flight into exile

   who were forced to flee, with Syria, Ethiopia, and Eritrea responsible
   for the most cases of exile. These are some of their stories.

• Journalist Assistance

   Most of the journalists CPJ has assisted in exile had little or no
   warning that they would be forced to flee, to undertake a journey of
   trauma and uncertainty. While their experiences have much in common
--
   Furthermore, the media community left behind is often intimidated into
   self-censorship and the public deprived of information. CPJ is
   releasing its annual survey of journalists in exile to mark World
   Refugee Day, June 20.

   While each journalist in exile has a unique tale to tell, every
   reporter, broadcaster, photojournalist, videographer, editor, blogger,
   and media worker forced to flee experiences similar dangers and must
   overcome similar milestones to reach any new semblance of normal life.
   This timeline looks in detail at the journeys into exile of eight
   journalists from around the world who fled their homes in recent years
   and sought support from CPJ. All of their comments are from interviews

The Journalism

   Some exiled journalists become targets after publishing or broadcasting
   one sensitive story. CPJ research shows that such stories are usually
   on politics, corruption, crime, war, or violence.
--
   assisted over the past five years cited fear of violence as their
   reason for leaving. In fact, Somalia, Syria, and Sri Lanka, which
   account for a quarter of CPJ’s exiled assistance cases, are all ranked
   among the top five countries on CPJ’s Impunity Index, which spotlights
   countries where journalists are murdered regularly and their killers go
--
   The other most common reason cited by journalists for fleeing is fear
   of imprisonment. Two countries who consistently jail journalists for
   their work, Iran and Ethiopia, are responsible for sending into exile
   about a quarter of the journalists CPJ has assisted over the past five
   years.
--
   successfully registered as a refugee, the date they receive for their
   resettlement interview is often one or two years in the future. And it
   is nearly impossible for exiled journalists to receive updates on the
   status of their case.

--
   The journalist believed his name would be recognized; he was terrified
   of being stopped and sent back to prison. Even in Khartoum, Sudan’s
   capital, he felt unsafe surrounded by so many exiled Eritreans. “I did
   not know who to trust,” he said. He traveled by car and on foot to
   South Sudan, passing several checkpoints and bribing officers to let
--
   As they wait among the community of refugees from their own country,
   journalists are extremely vulnerable because their work has made them
   recognizable. In many cases, journalists in exile continue to be
   targeted by their home governments, whose agents infiltrate refugee
   communities abroad. In some cases, home governments target the

   months after the attack on the city’s Westgate Mall that killed 67
   people, Kenya’s Ministry of Interior ordered all refugees to be
   relocated to refugee camps, a dangerous location for exiled
   journalists, CPJ research shows. “[Refugee] camps are not safe because
   there is no security, no police,” Abdifatah said. “Everyone knows who

   Al-Shabaab, believed to be responsible for the murders of many Somali
   journalists at home, has penetrated the camps. Ethiopian journalists
   exiled to Kenya are also targeted by the directive; they fear the
   presence of Ethiopian security agents in the camps.

   activities. Even though he is out of the country, he still feels
   vulnerable-a common sentiment among Iranian journalists in exile,
   according to CPJ research.

   Exiled journalists who go straight to the country where they apply for
   asylum also go through a difficult waiting period. Some journalists try
   to continue working while finding their footing in a new country, only

   with their life,” Ombara said.

   One of the worst factors of exile for journalists is the difficulty of
   continuing their career. Even once they have documentation allowing
   employment, language is a barrier for many. About 20% of journalists
   assisted by CPJ have continued to work in journalism after going into
   exile.

Faces of Exile

Share this:

   Since 2001, CPJ has documented the cases of 340 journalists forced into
   exile after their reporting exposed them to harassment, violence, or
   imprisonment. They face many difficulties in their new homes, from
   language and cultural adjustments to emotional and economic hardships.
   Here are five snapshots of journalists in exile.

   Date of exile: 2001

   Reason for leaving: Yafasova fled after she was threatened with

   Life in exile: Samad opted to remain outside the country and to seek
   asylum, which he won in January 2005. His family joined him in Canada
   in 2006, and he has held various non-journalism jobs since—as a
   security guard, a concierge, and a salesman. Once a prominent voice in
   Bangladesh, he was met with closed doors when he tried to continue
   working for Bangladeshi papers while in exile. He now contributes
   pieces to expatriate news Web sites and runs the pro-democracy blog
   Bangladesh Watchdog.

   On the professional cost of exile: “After I lost my steady job with the
   Bangladesh Observer, the international press stopped requesting
   contributions of articles about the region.”

   New home: Kenya

   Date of exile: 2007

   Reason for leaving: Tesfaye fled from the harassment and threats that

   Life in exile: Tesfaye has spent the past year in Nairobi, awaiting
   refugee resettlement through the United Nations High Commissioner for
   Refugees. In November 2007, Tesfaye and two fellow exiled journalists
   were assaulted in their apartment by men they believe were Ethiopian
   government agents. Tesfaye and his exiled colleagues keep a low
   profile. Unable to find work, they rely on small contributions from
   international organizations and family members in the diaspora.

   On the hardest part of life in exile: “Survival. There is no work here
   in Nairobi. You ask: Where will I get money? You are worried so much.
   Then you are forced to ask somebody, forced to be a beggar.”

   Reason for leaving: González Raga boarded a flight to Spain immediately

   Life in exile: Sigarchi lives outside Washington and has applied for

   On the decision to go into exile: “Maybe you expect I’d complain about
   exile, but I’m satisfied here because this is my choice. I had two
   options: one, to stay in Iran and be in prison under torture, and two,
   to be in exile.”

In African hot spots, journalists forced into exile

   leaving a deep void in professional reporting. The starkest examples
   are in the Horn of Africa nations of Somalia, Ethiopia, and Eritrea,
   where dozens of journalists have been forced into exile. Zimbabwe,
   Rwanda, and the Gambia have also lost large segments of the local press
   corps in the face of intimidation and violence.

   professional journalists has enabled governments or political factions
   to exert editorial control over once-independent news outlets. “The
   high exile rates of journalists have not brought a lack of information
   so much as misinformation,” said Abdiaziz Hassan, a local correspondent
   for Reuters in Somalia. “It incites the conflict further.”
--
   base of operations for the militant insurgent group Al-Shabaab—the
   station has seen five of its journalists killed, numerous staffers
   threatened, and several forced into exile. Without sufficient
   management on site, the station has been susceptible to pressure from
   Al-Shabaab to censor its coverage and even broadcast the group’s
   propaganda, according to Mohamed Amin, a former Shabelle deputy
   director now in exile.

   In all, CPJ has documented the cases of 30 Somali journalists who have
   gone into exile this decade, the fourth-highest tally worldwide during
   the period. CPJ’s data on exiled journalists include only those
   journalists who fled due to work-related persecution, who remained in
   exile for at least three months, and whose whereabouts and activities
   are known. Local organizations using different criteria report higher
   numbers. The Union of Exiled Somali Journalists, for example, counts as
   many as 80 exiled reporters. Most of these exiles have fled in the face
   of astonishing violence: Twenty-one Somali journalists have been killed
   in direct connection to their work since 2005, some at the hands of
--
   Al-Shabaab.

   Here’s another common thread: Most of the exiled Somali journalists
   speak English. That’s no coincidence, noted former Shabelle reporter
   Ahmednor Mohamed, who said insurgents have targeted English-speaking
--

   “There’s little question that the decimation of Somali journalists—by
   assassination or through exile—has reduced the quantity and quality of
   news coming out of that country,” Salopek said. “They were the first
   responders, if you will, to breaking news in Somalia. And most of them

   decade have been followed by years of steady repression. The threat of
   jail has led at least 41 Ethiopian journalists and 24 Eritreans into
   exile, CPJ data show, although local groups suggest the figures may be
   much higher.

   again ready to imprison critical reporters and editors. “Everything
   became illegal,” said Wondrad Debretsion, an Ethiopian editor who
   recently went into exile. “Even state-sponsored reporters have started
   fleeing the country.” The continuing exodus has weakened the
   independence of the remaining Ethiopian press. The Awramba Times, a
--
   rounded up 18 critical editors and reporters, jailed them without
   trial, and held them in secret locations. The crackdown pushed other
   independent reporters into exile, and effectively shuttered the
   independent press. The government’s heavy-handed repression has also
   forced out state-employed journalists, one of whom, Paulos Kidane, died
--


   Many exiled African journalists face great challenges and continuing
   risk. The Union of Exiled Somali Journalists said about half of its
   members eke out a precarious existence on the dangerous streets of
   Kenya’s capital, Nairobi. Most fled so precipitously that they took few
   belongings or identification papers. The exile union, along with the
   National Union of Somali Journalists, both said they had received
   reports that Somali exiles have faced arbitrary harassment and
   detention at the hands of Kenyan police.

   The Rwandan Mukombozi told CPJ that members of his family had been
   assaulted twice in Kigali after he was forced into exile. “All that
   psychological pressure more than triples when such incidents happen,”
   he said by e-mail, “and the restricted communication between the exiled
   journalist and his/her family makes the harm on both sides enormous.”

--
   but they are rarely at ease because of the suspected presence of
   Gambian security agents, said Demba Jawo, former head of the Gambian
   Press Union. “Sometimes exiled Gambian journalists feel compelled to
   move periodically to avoid detection from these security agents,” he
   said.

   Even those in safe circumstances face enormous professional challenges.
   At least 48 Zimbabwean journalists have been forced into exile since
   2000, most of them in the early half of the decade during sustained
   harassment by President Robert Mugabe’s government, according to CPJ
--

   Yet some who revived their careers also created a vibrant diaspora news
   media. Gerry Jackson, an exiled Zimbabwean journalist, launched the
   London-based SW Radio in 2001. The station broadcasts programming into
   Zimbabwe in English and in the Shona and Ndebele languages. Wilf
   Mbanga, another exile, started The Zimbabwean newspaper in 2005. Based
   in his new home in England, Mbanga produces a weekly that circulates in
   the United Kingdom, South Africa—and Zimbabwe. Abel Mutasakani, who
--
   the Web publication ZimOnline.

   Ethiopian and Eritrean exiles have similarly launched Web sites,
   typically focusing on events back home. While limited in what they can
   report firsthand, these sites receive and report leaked documents,
--
   commentary.

   The irony that exiled journalists are getting independent news and
   views into their native countries is not lost on people such as the
   Zimbabwean Geoff Hill. “Since nationalizing the press in 1981, Mugabe
   has done his best to control the flow of information, but now there are
   so many leaks in the bucket, it is more like a watering can,” said
   Hill, himself an exiled journalist who still reports on the country.
   “Much of the credit for this must go to the hard breed of Zimbabwean
   journalists—both at home and in exile—who refuse to surrender.”

   But this week his daughter-in-law revealed that Goldschmidt and his

     __________________________________________________________________

   Our image of the artist living in exile is often associated with the
   names of successful and well-known figures. But this is misleading,
   because making it as an artist in exile means overcoming a great many
   hurdles and many don’t make it.

   For artists in particular, the circumstances in which they can produce
   their art in exile are completely new. They depend on a market for
   their art, on a public and on public tastes. They need people who
   support them, people like gallery directors and publishers who can
   distribute their work or public events like concerts or theatre
   performances. In many cases, going into exile meant finding a new
   public, writing in the language of the receiving country and adapting
   to the market conditions there. It is difficult for artists to find
--
   off, and they often have to prioritise commissioned work over artistic
   independence. There are numerous examples of this among those who were
   forced to live in exile outside of the Nazi sphere of influence from
   1933 to 1945: one political graphic designer, for instance, worked as a
   book designer for travel guides, while many critical writers ended up
   writing scripts for Hollywood and Jewish actors even played Nazis in
   American anti-Nazi propaganda films. At the same time, networks and
   mutual support among those living in exile were vital to continuing
   their artistic work. By setting up their own publishing houses and
   other channels for publication as well as cultural associations, those
   in exile also created structures that helped against isolation and
   aimed to provide them with employment opportunities and publicity in
   the receiving countries. However, going into exile can also lead
   artists to cease their previous artistic activities completely. If
   artists are unable to find a way into the cultural scene in their exile
   country, for example, they may have no choice but to take on any kind
   of work just to earn a living and survive.

   The impact of exile and migration on the artistic process also gives
   rise to a great many questions when we look at contemporary artists
   living in exile; for example, how easy it is for artists to enter and
   find acceptance in the cultural scene of the receiving country.

     weit über die Kreise der „Betroffenen“ und die Fachkreise hinaus.

      [Accordingly, it seems to me that the job of exile studies is to
     train both the communicative and cultural memory using a
     historically and anthropologically relevant object. Studying exile
     in this way [...] would be listened to and understood far beyond the
     circle of those “affected” and outside of academic circles. (ed.

    of exile, 1995
     __________________________________________________________________

   What is it that exile studies deal with? The question about what
   subject matter exile research should deal with is one that has to be
   asked again and again. Today, in an era of migration, in which almost 3
   percent of the world population is made up of international migrants
   according to the German UNESCO Commission, issues such as the impact of
   exile on the countries of origin and the receiving countries, and the
   transfer of knowledge and culture are matters of interest for the world
   of research. The beginnings of exile studies are to be found in the
   early post-War period. Back then, it was those in exile who took it
   upon themselves to draw attention to the topic by providing overviews
   and anthologies about it.
--
   influences. In the GDR, where top political and cultural posts were
   filled by returned emigrants, research work focused on communist
   resistance and anti-fascist exile. In the Federal Republic, by
   comparison, a phase began during which public discussion was
   suppressed. Instead of looking at exile, West German historians
   concentrated on the civilian, church and military opposition to the
   Nazi regime.
--
   It was not until the middle of the 1960s that the changing social and
   political climate saw the beginning of a new phase of critically
   examining the Nazi past. The German Exile Archive of the German
   National Library laid down the groundwork for dealing with the subject
   in its 1965 exhibition Exil-Literatur 1933-1945. Research began by
   looking at literary and political exile in congresses, symposia and
   some initial publications. In 1969, the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft
   (German Research Foundation, DFG) provided funding and soon put
   together a programme of selective measures in the area of exile
   studies. The “other Germany” and the definition of anti-fascism were
   core aspects in the West German research work. Werner Berthold wrote
--
   reality (in: Nach dem »Paradigmenwechsel«. Brita Eckert and Harro
   Kieser in conversation with Werner Berthold, 1996). The mid-1980s saw
   further change and subjects like academics in exile (and in connection
   with this a turn towards acculturation research), exile among “normal”
   people (Wolfgang Benz) and research into women’s issues and gender came
   into focus. The expansion in research work to include Jewish exile was
   also down to a change in public awareness. The television series
   Holocaust (1979), the documentary film Shoah (1985) and the controversy
   among German historians in the 1980s are all evidence of this change in
   perception. The distinction, which had prevailed for many years,
   between political exile on the one hand and non-political – mainly
   Jewish – emigration on the other was abandoned.

   In 1984 the Gesellschaft für Exilforschung (German Exile Research
   Society) was set up with Ernst Loewy as its first chairman. For many
   years now, the field of exile research has been receiving input from
   the newer cultural studies, which critically re-examine terms like
   identity and homeland and are oriented towards the future we will be
   facing due to migrational movements. What exile studies still have to
   do is render the results of decades of research into German-language
   exile from 1933 to 1945 usable for studies of contemporary migration
   and exile and to bring its area of study into line with new research
   approaches.

     __________________________________________________________________

   People who go into exile leave a lot behind, especially if they have to
   escape quickly. In their families, often the only ones who can follow
   are direct relatives like husbands/wives and children; possessions and
--
   and the new start is uncertain.

   Hundreds of thousands of people who went into exile between 1933 and
   1945 had to face these everyday struggles, including an estimated
   10,000 artists and scientists. They were cut off from the professional
   contacts that they had established over time and faced the challenge of
   finding adequate work. A large number of exiles were thus reliant on
   financial assistance from friends and acquaintances, benefactors and
   aid organisations. The reports from exiles repeatedly mention the
   inconvenience of having to ask acquaintances for money. In October
   1940, author Mascha Kaléko wrote in her New York diary that she and
--
   paid jobs to secure their families’ survival with their income, while
   their husbands tried to get their careers going in the receiving
   country. However, this situation also enabled many women in exile to
   overcome traditional gender roles and have successful careers.

--
   contacts and friendships were at times hard to establish in the
   receiving country. For many, social life consisted only of contacts to
   other exiles. In part, the societies in the receiving countries were
   suspicious of and rejected the refugees. These are problems still faced
   by exiles and refugees who have had to leave their home countries.
   Prejudices against foreigners and racism often make it harder to start
   over in a new culture.

   1“Do we all belong to this country?” asks Nada Mustafa Ali in her book
   entitled: Gender, Race and Sudan’s Exile Politics. The title of the
   book is taken from a speech given in 1998 in Cairo by anthropologist
   Sharif Harir, the vice president of the Sudan Federal Democratic Party
--
   and politics in Sudan starting from the 1950s till the separation in
   2011. Using gender and intersectional perspectives, Ali examines the
   discourses and practices of the Sudanese opposition in exile. The
   author carefully analyses the interplay between gender and race, and to
   a lesser extent social class and religion, as tenants shaping Sudanese
--
   delves into the contemporary dynamics of women’s participation,
   discussions around women’s human rights, nationalism and gender
   equality in Sudan and in exile. She examines these questions looking
   closely at the opposition movements organised under the umbrella of the
   National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in exile in the 1990s and early
   2000s. She skillfully places these debates in a wider historical
   perspective of Sudanese politics which are developed in chapter 3,
--
   3One of the main contributions of the book is its longitudinal
   research, and Nada Ali’s personal involvement in the opposition
   movement and exile politics since mid-1990s and her particular
   commitment to feminist coalition building among different Sudanese
   women’s groups. In the introductory chapter, she discusses her
--
   movements in nation building. It provides rich interview material and
   in-depth analysis of documents and speeches, as well as author’s
   encounters with the different women’s groups and activists in exile.
   Ali provides detailed feminist and intersectional analysis of Sudanese
   women’s activisms throughout the 20^th century, with a careful
   examination of the activities of exiled Sudanese and South Sudanese
   women in the 1990s and 2000s. Chapter 4 examines in depth the gendered
   discourses and, and to a lesser extent, practices of the Sudanese
   opposition in exile. Chapter 5, on the other hand, focuses its analysis
   on the ways gender and race were intertwined in the emancipatory
   project of New Sudan. Ali shows also how this vision turned later into

2019 update: How long do refugees stay in exile? To find out, beware of
averages

   Number of refugees by years in exile

   "The average length of time that refugees spend in camps is 17 years."

   longest situations, not of all situations. Most importantly, it refers
   to the duration of situations, not to the time people have stayed in
   exile.

   Take the situation of Somali refugees in Kenya. Refugees started to
   arrive massively around 1993, about 26 years ago. Their number now
   stands at 252,500. But can we say that all 252,500 have been in exile
   for 26 years?

--

   So what are the results?
   Figure 2 Global number of refugees by year of exile
   Figure 2. Global number of refugees by year of exile

   When we look at the "global refugee population" (see Figure 2), we can
--

   Now let’s group these figures by largest waves of arrivals (Figure 3):
   Number of refugees by years in exile –Grouped by country
   Figure 3. Number of refugees by years in exile –Grouped by country

   There is a large cohort of about 8.5 million "recent refugees," who
--

   Another large cohort, of about 6.4 million, has spent between 5 and 9
   years in exile. It includes refugees from Syria (3.6 million), South
   Sudan (0.6 million), the bulk of the current Somali refugees (0.3
   million), and people fleeing from Sudan (0.3 million), the Central
--
   Democratic Republic of Congo (0.2 million).

   About 3.2 million people have been in exile between 10 and 34 years.
   This includes years during which numbers are relatively low, and two
   episodes where they are higher, around 17 years ago, with the arrival
--
   the arrival of about 0.5 million Somalis and 0.2 million Eritreans.

   Lastly, a large group of refugees has been in exile for 35 to 40 years:
   these 2.2 million refugees include mainly Afghans (1.9 million), but
   also about 0.3 million Vietnamese who fled their country during the
--

   We can now turn to average durations. As of end-2018, the median
   duration of exile stands at 5 years, i.e. half of the refugees
   worldwide have spent 5 years or less in exile. The median has
   fluctuated widely since the end of the Cold War, in 1991, between 4 and
   14 years. By contrast, the mean duration stands at 10.3 years, and has
--

   But this leads to another important finding: trends can be
   counter-intuitive. In fact, a decline in the average duration of exile
   is typically not an improvement, but rather the consequence of a
   degradation of the global situation . The averages increase in years
--

   We also looked at the number of people who have spent more than five
   years in exile. As of end-2018, this number stands at 11.9 million. The
   number of protracted refugees had been remarkably stable since 1991 at
   5 to 7 million throughout most of the period, before dramatically
   jumping in the last 3 years.   For this group, the average duration of
   exile increases over time – largely because of the unresolved situation
   of Afghan refugees which pushes averages up. It is now well over 20
   years.

At last moment, BBC drops documentary on Jewish exile

Filmmaker Ilan Ziv says move stems from incompetence, naivete, political
--

   A last-minute decision by the BBC to drop a documentary that questions
   the extent of the Jewish exile after the Roman destruction of Jerusalem
   in 70 CE was a mixture of “incompetence,” “political naiveté” and “lack
   of courage,” the Israeli filmmaker behind the project has charged.

   modern-day Palestinians could be partially descended from Jews who
   never left the region, was due to be shown in modified form by the BBC

Libyan exile’s life captured vividly on film

   The recently released documentary The Colonel’s Stray Dogs provides a
--
   journalist Ashur Shamis, 72. Its title, The Colonel’s Stray Dogs, is
   taken from a statement by Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 1980 giving
   orders to eliminate all the country’s “stray dogs” – exiles living
   abroad – and telling them to either return or face “physical
   liquidation”.
--
   documentary provides a deeply personal window into the tragedy of Libya
   by interrogating his life-long sacrifice against the backdrop of his
   life, and that of his family, in exile. It is being screened at the
   Durban International Film Festival until 1 August.
   19 April 2021: Director Khalid Shamis spent 10 years making his film

   his dedication to the struggle for freedom, and the cost of that. “My
   dad opposed Gaddafi for most of his life,” Shamis says in the film’s
   opening lines. “For the 40 years he was in exile in England, it felt
   like killing Gaddafi was more important to him than living with us.”

--
   later, a journalist working for the BBC World Service.

   While in exile, Ashur joined members of the London-based National Front
   for the Salvation of Libya (NFSL), which was formed in 1981 with the
   core focus of creating a democratic Islamic society. Its members

   The revolution once imagined did not happen and the freedom dreams held
   for Libya were not actualised. The country was deeply fractured, many
   returning exiles were marginalised and the government continued to
   remain unstable – a situation that remains to this day and is often
   referred to as the “Libyan crisis”. Ashur, despondent and unable to

   exile.

   To his credit as a filmmaker, Shamis is able to convey the story from

   Shamis’ unconventional approach to telling his father’s story paints a
   fragile journey in heroic mode. Ultimately, it is a tragic story about
   the dream for freedom and its personal costs – one to which many exiles
   around the world can relate.
